long_description    DuckDB is an embedded database designed to execute \
                    analytical SQL queries fast while embedded in another \
                    process. It is designed to be easy to install and easy to \
                    use. DuckDB has no external dependencies. DuckDB has \
                    bindings for C/C++, Python and R. DuckDB is developed by \
                    the Database Architectures group of the CWI.

description                 SOCI - The C++ Database Access Library

long_description            SOCI is a database access library for C++ that makes the illusion of \
                            embedding SQL queries in the regular C++ code, staying entirely within \
                            the Standard C++. The idea is to provide C++ programmers a way to \
                            access SQL databases in the most natural and intuitive way. If you \
                            find existing libraries too difficult for your needs or just \
                            distracting, SOCI can be a good alternative.

description         PostgreSQL diff tool that is useful for comparison/diffing of database schemas.

long_description    Another PostgreSQL Diff Tool (also known as apgdiff) is \
                    free PostgreSQL diff tool that is useful for comparison/diffing \
                    of database schemas. The tool compares two database dump \
                    files and creates output with DDL statements that can be used \
                    to update old database schema to new one or to see in what \
                    exactly both databases differ. It is already being used by many \
                    developers all over the world.

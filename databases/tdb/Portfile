description         TDB is a Trivial Database
long_description    TDB is a Trivial Database. In concept, it is very much \
                    like GDBM, and BSD's DB except that it allows multiple \
                    simultaneous writers and uses locking internally to keep \
                    writers from trampling on each other. TDB is also \
                    extremely small.

description         sitecopy website maintenance utility
long_description    sitecopy allows you to easily maintain remote Web sites. The program \
                    will upload files to the server which have changed locally, and delete \
                    files from the server which have been removed locally, keeping the \
                    remote site synchronized. FTP and WebDAV are supported.

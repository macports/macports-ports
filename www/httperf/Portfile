description      tool for measuring webserver performance
long_description \
    httperf is a tool for measuring web server performance. It \
    provides a flexible facility for generating various HTTP \
    workloads and for measuring server performance. The focus of \
    httperf is not on implementing one particular benchmark but \
    on providing a robust, high-performance tool that \
    facilitates the construction of both micro- and macro-level \
    benchmarks. The three distinguishing characteristics of \
    httperf are its robustness, which includes the ability to \
    generate and sustain server overload, support for the \
    HTTP/1.1 protocol, and its extensibility to new workload \
    generators and performance measurements.

description			Apache mod_jk2 remote server connector (from Tomcat).
long_description	mod_jk2 provides a connection between apache2 and a remote \
					server. It passes incoming requests on to the remote server \
 					for handling. Configurations may be mixed such that each \
					server handles a particular type of request. mod_jk2 comes \
					from the Java based Tomcat server, and is usually used with it. \
					As of Nov, 2004, mod_jk2 has been officially 'unsupported' by apache. \
					mod_jk, which jk2 once superceeded, has once again become the golden \
					child. Please refer to the mod_jk port, and to apache2.1, where a new \
					core module, proxy_ajp, replaces mod_jk2.

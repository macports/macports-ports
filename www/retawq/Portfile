long_description \
    retawq is an interactive, multi-threaded network client \
    (web browser) for text terminals on computers with \
    Unix-like operating systems. It is fast, small, nicely \
    configurable, and comfortable, e.g. the low-level \
    network communications are performed in a non-blocking \
    way, and you can keep open as many virtual windows \
    as you want and work simultaneously in two of them in \
    a split-screen mode.

long_description	The Local File System is an add-in product for \
			the Zope web application server. It allows users \
			to access the contents of the file system on a \
			Zope server as if they were contained in the \
			Zope Object Database. It allows you to serve \
			files and browse directories from the local file \
			system (or network shares on Windows platforms). \
			It also allows you to upload files to the file \
			system.

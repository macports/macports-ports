description         A webmail system which accesses mail over IMAP
long_description    SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written \
                    in PHP4. It includes built-in pure PHP support for the \
                    IMAP and SMTP protocols, and all pages render in pure HTML \
                    4.0 (with no JavaScript) for maximum compatibility across \
                    browsers. It has very few requirements and is very easy to \
                    configure and install. SquirrelMail has all the \
                    functionality you would want from an email client, \
                    including strong MIME support, address books, and folder \
                    manipulation.

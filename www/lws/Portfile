description      The Lil' Web Server
long_description \
	LWS is a lightweight web server which uses pthreads(3) for \
	multi-tasking and the PDEL library for HTTP, HTTPS, and \
	configurable servlet support. The server can be configured \
	via a buit-in admin web interface, or by manually editing \
	the XML configuration file. LWS supports multiple HTTP and \
	HTTPS servers, each containing multiple virtual hosts. \
	Each virtual host has a configurable list of servlets. The \
	supported servlets types are file, redirect, and cookieauth. \
	The file servlet includes optional support for tmpl(3) HTML \
	templates. LWS maintains a self-rotating logfile(3) error \
	log, with optional support for logging via syslog as well. \
	LWS is intended to demonstrate features of the PDEL library, \
	and to be a lightweight web server for simple applications.

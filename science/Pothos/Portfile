description         Pothos is Software Defined Radio (SDR) with a \
    complete data-flow framework for creating topologies of \
    interconnected processing blocks.
long_description    ${description} \
    Topologies can be designed and tested graphically, and \
    deployed over a network. The Pothos framework API is sleek and smart, \
    enabling users to quickly create custom processing blocks with minimal \
    boiler-plate. Processing blocks can support computational offload and \
    integration with SoC and DMA devices.

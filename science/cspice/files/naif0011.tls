Explanation:
------------

The contents of this file are used by the routine DELTET to compute the 
time difference

[1]       DELTA_ET  =  ET - UTC                                         
          
the increment to be applied to UTC to give ET. 

The difference between UTC and TAI,

[2]       DELTA_AT  =  TAI - UTC

is always an integral number of seconds. The value of DELTA_AT was 10
seconds in January 1972, and increases by one each time a leap second
is declared. Combining [1] and [2] gives

[3]       DELTA_ET  =  ET - (TAI - DELTA_AT)

                    =  (ET - TAI) + DELTA_AT

The difference (ET - TAI) is periodic, and is given by

[4]       ET - TAI  =  DELTA_T_A  + K sin E 

where DELTA_T_A and K are constant, and E is the eccentric anomaly of the 
heliocentric orbit of the Earth-Moon barycenter. Equation [4], which ignores 
small-period fluctuations, is accurate to about 0.000030 seconds.

The eccentric anomaly E is given by 

[5]       E = M + EB sin M

where M is the mean anomaly, which in turn is given by 

[6]       M = M  +  M t
               0     1

where t is the number of ephemeris seconds past J2000.

Thus, in order to compute DELTA_ET, the following items are necessary.

          DELTA_TA
          K
          EB
          M0
          M1
          DELTA_AT      after each leap second.

The numbers, and the formulation, are taken from the following sources.

        Coordinate Time in Solar System Barycentric Space-Time Frame
        of Reference, Parts 1 and 2, Celestial Mechanics 23 (1981),

The variable names used above are consistent with those used in the 
Astronomical Almanac.

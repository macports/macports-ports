##  condor_config
##
##  This is the global configuration file for condor.  Any settings
##  made here may potentially be overridden in the local configuration
##  file.  KEEP THAT IN MIND!  To double-check that a variable is
##  getting set from the configuration file that you expect, use
##  condor_config_val -v <variable name>
##
##  The file is divided into four main parts:
##  Part 1:  Settings you likely want to customize 
##  Part 2:  Settings you may want to customize
##  Part 3:  Settings that control the policy of when condor will
##           start and stop jobs on your machines
##  Part 4:  Settings you should probably leave alone (unless you
##  know what you're doing)
##
##  Please read the INSTALL file (or the Install chapter in the
##  Condor Administrator's Manual) for detailed explanations of the 
##  various settings in here and possible ways to configure your
##  pool. 
##
##  Unless otherwise specified, settings that are commented out show
##  the defaults that are used if you don't define a value.  Settings
##  that are defined here MUST BE DEFINED since they have no default
##  value.
##
##  Unless otherwise indicated, all settings which specify a time are
##  defined in seconds.

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Flocking: Submitting jobs to more than one pool
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Flocking allows you to run your jobs in other pools, or lets
##  others run jobs in your pool.
## 
##  To let others flock to you, define FLOCK_FROM.
## 
##  To flock to others, define FLOCK_TO.

##  FLOCK_FROM defines the machines where you would like to grant
##  people access to your pool via flocking. (i.e. you are granting
##  access to these machines to join your pool).
FLOCK_FROM = 
##  An example of this is:
#FLOCK_FROM = somehost.friendly.domain, anotherhost.friendly.domain

##  FLOCK_TO defines the central managers of the pools that you want
##  to flock to. (i.e. you are specifying the machines that you
##  want your jobs to be negotiated at -- thereby specifying the
##  pools they will run in.)
FLOCK_TO = 
##  An example of this is:
#FLOCK_TO = central_manager.friendly.domain, condor.cs.wisc.edu

##  FLOCK_COLLECTOR_HOSTS should almost always be the same as
##  FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS (as shown below).  The only reason it would be
##  different is if the collector and negotiator in the pool that you are
##  flocking too are running on different machines (not recommended).
##  The collectors must be specified in the same corresponding order as
##  the FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS list.
FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS = $(FLOCK_TO)
FLOCK_COLLECTOR_HOSTS = $(FLOCK_TO)
## An example of having the negotiator and the collector on different
## machines is:
#FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS = condor.cs.wisc.edu, condor-negotiator.friendly.domain
#FLOCK_COLLECTOR_HOSTS =  condor.cs.wisc.edu, condor-collector.friendly.domain

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Host/IP access levels
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Please see the administrator's manual for details on these
##  settings, what they're for, and how to use them.

##  What machines have administrative rights for your pool?  This
##  defaults to your central manager.  You should set it to the
##  machine(s) where whoever is the condor administrator(s) works
##  (assuming you trust all the users who log into that/those
##  machine(s), since this is machine-wide access you're granting).
ALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST), $(IP_ADDRESS)

##  If there are no machines that should have administrative access 
##  to your pool (for example, there's no machine where only trusted
##  users have accounts), you can uncomment this setting.
##  Unfortunately, this will mean that administering your pool will 
##  be more difficult.
#DENY_ADMINISTRATOR = *

##  What machines should have "owner" access to your machines, meaning
##  they can issue commands that a machine owner should be able to
##  issue to their own machine (like condor_vacate).  This defaults to
##  machines with administrator access, and the local machine.  This
##  is probably what you want.
ALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(ALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)

##  Read access.  Machines listed as allow (and/or not listed as deny)
##  can view the status of your pool, but cannot join your pool 
##  or run jobs.
##  NOTE: By default, without these entries customized, you
##  are granting read access to the whole world.  You may want to
##  restrict that to hosts in your domain.  If possible, please also
##  grant read access to "*.cs.wisc.edu", so the Condor developers
##  will be able to view the status of your pool and more easily help
##  you install, configure or debug your Condor installation.
##  It is important to have this defined.
ALLOW_READ = * 
#ALLOW_READ = *.your.domain, *.cs.wisc.edu
#DENY_READ = *.bad.subnet, bad-machine.your.domain, 144.77.88.*

##  Write access.  Machines listed here can join your pool, submit
##  jobs, etc.  Note: Any machine which has WRITE access must
##  also be granted READ access.  Granting WRITE access below does
##  not also automatically grant READ access; you must change
##  ALLOW_READ above as well.
##
##  You must set this to something else before Condor will run.
##  This most simple option is:
##    ALLOW_WRITE = *
##  but note that this will allow anyone to submit jobs or add
##  machines to your pool and is a serious security risk.

ALLOW_WRITE = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), 127.0.0.1
#ALLOW_WRITE = *.your.domain, your-friend's-machine.other.domain
#DENY_WRITE = bad-machine.your.domain

##  Are you upgrading to a new version of Condor and confused about
##  why the above ALLOW_WRITE setting is causing Condor to refuse to
##  start up?  If you are upgrading from a configuration that uses
##  HOSTALLOW/HOSTDENY instead of ALLOW/DENY we recommend that you
##  convert all uses of the former to the latter.  The syntax of the
##  authorization settings is identical.  They both support
##  unauthenticated IP-based authorization as well as authenticated
##  user-based authorization.  To avoid confusion, the use of
##  HOSTALLOW/HOSTDENY is discouraged.  Support for it may be removed
##  in the future.

##  Negotiator access.  Machines listed here are trusted central
##  managers.  You should normally not have to change this.
ALLOW_NEGOTIATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST), $(IP_ADDRESS)
##  Now, with flocking we need to let the SCHEDD trust the other 
##  negotiators we are flocking with as well.  You should normally 
##  not have to change this either.
ALLOW_NEGOTIATOR_SCHEDD = $(CONDOR_HOST), $(FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS), $(IP_ADDRESS)

##  Config access.  Machines listed here can use the condor_config_val
##  tool to modify all daemon configurations.  This level of host-wide
##  access should only be granted with extreme caution.  By default,
##  config access is denied from all hosts.
#ALLOW_CONFIG = trusted-host.your.domain

##  Flocking Configs.  These are the real things that Condor looks at,
##  but we set them from the FLOCK_FROM/TO macros above.  It is safe
##  to leave these unchanged.
ALLOW_WRITE_COLLECTOR = $(ALLOW_WRITE), $(FLOCK_FROM)
ALLOW_WRITE_STARTD    = $(ALLOW_WRITE), $(FLOCK_FROM)
ALLOW_READ_COLLECTOR  = $(ALLOW_READ), $(FLOCK_FROM)
ALLOW_READ_STARTD     = $(ALLOW_READ), $(FLOCK_FROM)


##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Security parameters for setting configuration values remotely:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  These parameters define the list of attributes that can be set
##  remotely with condor_config_val for the security access levels
##  defined above (for example, WRITE, ADMINISTRATOR, CONFIG, etc).
##  Please see the administrator's manual for further details on these
##  settings, what they're for, and how to use them.  There are no
##  default values for any of these settings.  If they are not
##  defined, no attributes can be set with condor_config_val.

## Do you want to allow condor_config_val -reset to work at all?
## This feature is disabled by default, so to enable, you must
## uncomment the following setting and change the value to "True". 
## Note: changing this requires a restart not just a reconfig.
#ENABLE_RUNTIME_CONFIG = False

## Do you want to allow condor_config_val -set to work at all?
## This feature is disabled by default, so to enable, you must
## uncomment the following setting and change the value to "True". 
## Note: changing this requires a restart not just a reconfig.
#ENABLE_PERSISTENT_CONFIG = False

## Directory where daemons should write persistent config files (used
## to support condor_config_val -set).  This directory should *ONLY*
## be writable by root (or the user the Condor daemons are running as
## if non-root).  There is no default, administrators must define this.
## Note: changing this requires a restart not just a reconfig.
#PERSISTENT_CONFIG_DIR = /full/path/to/root-only/local/directory

##  Attributes that can be set by hosts with "CONFIG" permission (as
##  defined with ALLOW_CONFIG and DENY_CONFIG above).
##  The commented-out value here was the default behavior of Condor
##  prior to version 6.3.3.  If you don't need this behavior, you
##  should leave this commented out.
#SETTABLE_ATTRS_CONFIG = *

##  Attributes that can be set by hosts with "ADMINISTRATOR"
##  permission (as defined above)
#SETTABLE_ATTRS_ADMINISTRATOR = *_DEBUG, MAX_*_LOG

##  Attributes that can be set by hosts with "OWNER" permission (as
##  defined above) NOTE: any Condor job running on a given host will
##  have OWNER permission on that host by default.  If you grant this
##  kind of access, Condor jobs will be able to modify any attributes
##  you list below on the machine where they are running.  This has
##  obvious security implications, so only grant this kind of
##  permission for custom attributes that you define for your own use
##  at your pool (custom attributes about your machines that are
##  published with the STARTD_ATTRS setting, for example).
#SETTABLE_ATTRS_OWNER = your_custom_attribute, another_custom_attr

##  You can also define daemon-specific versions of each of these
##  settings.  For example, to define settings that can only be
##  changed in the condor_startd's configuration by hosts with OWNER
##  permission, you would use:
#STARTD_SETTABLE_ATTRS_OWNER = your_custom_attribute_name


##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Network filesystem parameters:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Do you want to use NFS for file access instead of remote system
##  calls?
#USE_NFS		= False

##  Do you want to use AFS for file access instead of remote system
##  calls?
#USE_AFS		= False

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Checkpoint server:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Do you want to use a checkpoint server if one is available?  If a
##  checkpoint server isn't available or USE_CKPT_SERVER is set to
##  False, checkpoints will be written to the local SPOOL directory on
##  the submission machine.
#USE_CKPT_SERVER	= True

##  What's the hostname of this machine's nearest checkpoint server?
#CKPT_SERVER_HOST	= checkpoint-server-hostname.your.domain

##  Do you want the starter on the execute machine to choose the
##  checkpoint server?  If False, the CKPT_SERVER_HOST set on
##  the submit machine is used.  Otherwise, the CKPT_SERVER_HOST set
##  on the execute machine is used.  The default is true.
#STARTER_CHOOSES_CKPT_SERVER = True

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Miscellaneous:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Try to save this much swap space by not starting new shadows.  
##  Specified in megabytes.
#RESERVED_SWAP		= 0

##  What's the maximum number of jobs you want a single submit machine
##  to spawn shadows for?  The default is a function of $(DETECTED_MEMORY)
##  and a guess at the number of ephemeral ports available.

## Example 1:
#MAX_JOBS_RUNNING	= 10000

## Example 2:
## This is more complicated, but it produces the same limit as the default.
## First define some expressions to use in our calculation.
## Assume we can use up to 80% of memory and estimate shadow private data
## size of 800k.
#MAX_SHADOWS_MEM	= ceiling($(DETECTED_MEMORY)*0.8*1024/800)
## Assume we can use ~21,000 ephemeral ports (avg ~2.1 per shadow).
## Under Linux, the range is set in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range.
#MAX_SHADOWS_PORTS	= 10000
## Under windows, things are much less scalable, currently.
## Note that this can probably be safely increased a bit under 64-bit windows.
#MAX_SHADOWS_OPSYS	= ifThenElse(regexp("WIN.*","$(OPSYS)"),200,100000)
## Now build up the expression for MAX_JOBS_RUNNING.  This is complicated
## due to lack of a min() function.
#MAX_JOBS_RUNNING	= $(MAX_SHADOWS_MEM)
#MAX_JOBS_RUNNING	= \
#  ifThenElse( $(MAX_SHADOWS_PORTS) < $(MAX_JOBS_RUNNING), \
#              $(MAX_SHADOWS_PORTS), \
#              $(MAX_JOBS_RUNNING) )
#MAX_JOBS_RUNNING	= \
#  ifThenElse( $(MAX_SHADOWS_OPSYS) < $(MAX_JOBS_RUNNING), \
#              $(MAX_SHADOWS_OPSYS), \
#              $(MAX_JOBS_RUNNING) )


##  Maximum number of simultaneous downloads of output files from
##  execute machines to the submit machine (limit applied per schedd).
##  The value 0 means unlimited.
#MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS = 10

##  Maximum number of simultaneous uploads of input files from the
##  submit machine to execute machines (limit applied per schedd).
##  The value 0 means unlimited.
#MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS = 10

##  Condor needs to create a few lock files to synchronize access to
##  various log files.  Because of problems we've had with network
##  filesystems and file locking over the years, we HIGHLY recommend
##  that you put these lock files on a local partition on each
##  machine.  If you don't have your LOCAL_DIR on a local partition,
##  be sure to change this entry.  Whatever user (or group) condor is
##  running as needs to have write access to this directory.  If
##  you're not running as root, this is whatever user you started up
##  the condor_master as.  If you are running as root, and there's a
##  condor account, it's probably condor.  Otherwise, it's whatever
##  you've set in the CONDOR_IDS environment variable.  See the Admin
##  manual for details on this.
LOCK		= $(LOG)

##  If you don't use a fully qualified name in your /etc/hosts file
##  (or NIS, etc.) for either your official hostname or as an alias,
##  Condor wouldn't normally be able to use fully qualified names in
##  places that it'd like to.  You can set this parameter to the
##  domain you'd like appended to your hostname, if changing your host
##  information isn't a good option.  This parameter must be set in
##  the global config file (not the LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE from above). 
#DEFAULT_DOMAIN_NAME = your.domain.name

##  If you don't have DNS set up, Condor will normally fail in many
##  places because it can't resolve hostnames to IP addresses and
##  vice-versa. If you enable this option, Condor will use
##  pseudo-hostnames constructed from a machine's IP address and the
##  DEFAULT_DOMAIN_NAME. Both NO_DNS and DEFAULT_DOMAIN must be set in
##  your top-level config file for this mode of operation to work
##  properly.
#NO_DNS = True

##  Condor can be told whether or not you want the Condor daemons to
##  create a core file if something really bad happens.  This just
##  sets the resource limit for the size of a core file.  By default,
##  we don't do anything, and leave in place whatever limit was in
##  effect when you started the Condor daemons.  If this parameter is
##  set and "True", we increase the limit to as large as it gets.  If
##  it's set to "False", we set the limit at 0 (which means that no
##  core files are even created).  Core files greatly help the Condor
##  developers debug any problems you might be having.
#CREATE_CORE_FILES	= True

##  When Condor daemons detect a fatal internal exception, they
##  normally log an error message and exit.  If you have turned on
##  CREATE_CORE_FILES, in some cases you may also want to turn on
##  ABORT_ON_EXCEPTION so that core files are generated when an
##  exception occurs.  Set the following to True if that is what you
##  want.
#ABORT_ON_EXCEPTION = False

##  Condor Glidein downloads binaries from a remote server for the
##  machines into which you're gliding. This saves you from manually
##  downloading and installing binaries for every architecture you
##  might want to glidein to. The default server is one maintained at
##  The University of Wisconsin. If you don't want to use the UW
##  server, you can set up your own and change the following to
##  point to it, instead.
GLIDEIN_SERVER_URLS = \
  http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/glidein/binaries

## List the sites you want to GlideIn to on the GLIDEIN_SITES. For example, 
## if you'd like to GlideIn to some Alliance GiB resources, 
## uncomment the line below.
## Make sure that $(GLIDEIN_SITES) is included in ALLOW_READ and
## ALLOW_WRITE, or else your GlideIns won't be able to join your pool.
## This is _NOT_ done for you by default, because it is an even better
## idea to use a strong security method (such as GSI) rather than
## host-based security for authorizing glideins.
#GLIDEIN_SITES = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu, *.cs.wisc.edu, *.mcs.anl.gov 
#GLIDEIN_SITES = 

##  If your site needs to use UID_DOMAIN settings (defined above) that
##  are not real Internet domains that match the hostnames, you can
##  tell Condor to trust whatever UID_DOMAIN a submit machine gives to
##  the execute machine and just make sure the two strings match.  The
##  default for this setting is False, since it is more secure this
##  way.
#TRUST_UID_DOMAIN = False

## If you would like to be informed in near real-time via condor_q when
## a vanilla/standard/java job is in a suspension state, set this attribute to
## TRUE. However, this real-time update of the condor_schedd by the shadows 
## could cause performance issues if there are thousands of concurrently
## running vanilla/standard/java jobs under a single condor_schedd and they
## are allowed to suspend and resume.
#REAL_TIME_JOB_SUSPEND_UPDATES = False

## A standard universe job can perform arbitrary shell calls via the
## libc 'system()' function. This function call is routed back to the shadow
## which performs the actual system() invocation in the initial directory of the
## running program and as the user who submitted the job. However, since the
## user job can request ARBITRARY shell commands to be run by the shadow, this
## is a generally unsafe practice. This should only be made available if it is
## actually needed. If this attribute is not defined, then it is the same as
## it being defined to False. Set it to True to allow the shadow to execute
## arbitrary shell code from the user job.
#SHADOW_ALLOW_UNSAFE_REMOTE_EXEC = False

## KEEP_OUTPUT_SANDBOX is an optional feature to tell Condor-G to not
## remove the job spool when the job leaves the queue.  To use, just
## set to TRUE.  Since you will be operating Condor-G in this manner,
## you may want to put leave_in_queue = false in your job submit
## description files, to tell Condor-G to simply remove the job from
## the queue immediately when the job completes (since the output files
## will stick around no matter what).
#KEEP_OUTPUT_SANDBOX = False

## This setting tells the negotiator to ignore user priorities.  This
## avoids problems where jobs from different users won't run when using
## condor_advertise instead of a full-blown startd (some of the user
## priority system in Condor relies on information from the startd --
## we will remove this reliance when we support the user priority
## system for grid sites in the negotiator; for now, this setting will
## just disable it).
#NEGOTIATOR_IGNORE_USER_PRIORITIES = False

## This is a list of libraries containing ClassAd plug-in functions.
#CLASSAD_USER_LIBS =

## This setting tells Condor whether to delegate or copy GSI X509
## credentials when sending them over the wire between daemons.
## Delegation can take up to a second, which is very slow when
## submitting a large number of jobs. Copying exposes the credential
## to third parties if Condor isn't set to encrypt communications.
## By default, Condor will delegate rather than copy.
#DELEGATE_JOB_GSI_CREDENTIALS = True

## This setting controls whether Condor delegates a full or limited
## X509 credential for jobs. Currently, this only affects grid-type
## gt2 grid universe jobs. The default is False.
#DELEGATE_FULL_JOB_GSI_CREDENTIALS = False

## This setting controls the default behavior for the spooling of files
## into, or out of, the Condor system by such tools as condor_submit
## and condor_transfer_data. Here is the list of valid settings for this
## parameter and what they mean:
##
##   stm_use_schedd_only
##      Ask the condor_schedd to solely store/retrieve the sandbox
##
##   stm_use_transferd
##      Ask the condor_schedd for a location of a condor_transferd, then
##      store/retrieve the sandbox from the transferd itself.
##
## The allowed values are case insensitive.
## The default of this parameter if not specified is: stm_use_schedd_only
#SANDBOX_TRANSFER_METHOD = stm_use_schedd_only

## This setting specifies an IP address that depends on the setting of
## BIND_ALL_INTERFACES. If BIND_ALL_INTERFACES  is True (the default), then
## this variable controls what IP address will be advertised as the public
## address of the daemon. If BIND_ALL_INTERFACES is False, then this variable
## specifies which IP address to bind network sockets to. If
## BIND_ALL_INTERFACES is False  and NETWORK_INTERFACE is not defined, Condor
## chooses a network interface automatically. It tries to choose a public
## interface if one is available. If it cannot decide which of two interfaces
## to choose from, it will pick the first one.
NETWORK_INTERFACE = 127.0.0.1

##  The rank expressions used by the negotiator are configured below.

##    1. NEGOTIATOR_PRE_JOB_RANK
##    2. rank in job ClassAd
##    3. NEGOTIATOR_POST_JOB_RANK
##    4. cause of preemption (0=user priority,1=startd rank,2=no preemption)
##    5. PREEMPTION_RANK

##  The NEGOTIATOR_PRE_JOB_RANK expression overrides all other ranks
##  that are used to pick a match from the set of possibilities.
##  The following expression matches jobs to unclaimed resources
##  whenever possible, regardless of the job-supplied rank.
UWCS_NEGOTIATOR_PRE_JOB_RANK = RemoteOwner =?= UNDEFINED

##  The NEGOTIATOR_POST_JOB_RANK expression chooses between
##  resources that are equally preferred by the job.
##  The following example expression steers jobs toward
##  faster machines and tends to fill a cluster of multiprocessors
##  breadth-first instead of depth-first.  It also prefers online
##  machines over offline (hibernating) ones.  In this example,
##  the expression is chosen to have no effect when preemption
##  would take place, allowing control to pass on to
##  PREEMPTION_RANK.
UWCS_NEGOTIATOR_POST_JOB_RANK = \
 (RemoteOwner =?= UNDEFINED) * (KFlops - SlotID - 1.0e10*(Offline=?=True))

##  The negotiator will not preempt a job running on a given machine
##  unless the PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS expression evaluates to true
##  and the owner of the idle job has a better priority than the owner
##  of the running job.  This expression defaults to true.
UWCS_PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS = ((SubmitterGroup =?= RemoteGroup) \
        && ($(StateTimer) > (1 * $(HOUR))) \
	&& (RemoteUserPrio > TARGET.SubmitterUserPrio * 1.2)) \
        || (MY.NiceUser == True)

##  The PREEMPTION_RANK expression is used in a case where preemption
##  is the only option and all other negotiation ranks are equal.  For
##  example, if the job has no preference, it is usually preferable to
##  preempt a job with a small ImageSize instead of a job with a large
##  ImageSize.  The default is to rank all preemptable matches the
##  same.  However, the negotiator will always prefer to match the job
##  with an idle machine over a preemptable machine, if all other
##  negotiation ranks are equal.
UWCS_PREEMPTION_RANK = (RemoteUserPrio * 1000000) - TARGET.ImageSize

##  Lock files
SHADOW_LOCK	= $(LOCK)/ShadowLock

## This setting controls how often any lock files currently in use have their
## time stamp updated. Updating the time stamp prevents administrative programs 
## like 'tmpwatch' from deleting long lived lock files. The parameter is
## an integer in seconds with a minimum of 60 seconds. The default if not
## specified is 28800 seconds, or 8 hours.
## This attribute only takes effect on restart of the daemons or at the next
## update time.
# LOCK_FILE_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 28800

##  This setting primarily allows you to change the port that the
##  collector is listening on.  By default, the collector uses port
##  9618, but you can set the port with a ":port", such as:
##  COLLECTOR_HOST = $(CONDOR_HOST):1234
COLLECTOR_HOST  = $(CONDOR_HOST)

## The NEGOTIATOR_HOST parameter has been deprecated.  The port where
## the negotiator is listening is now dynamically allocated and the IP
## and port are now obtained from the collector, just like all the
## other daemons.  However, if your pool contains any machines that
## are running version 6.7.3 or earlier, you can uncomment this
## setting to go back to the old fixed-port (9614) for the negotiator.
#NEGOTIATOR_HOST = $(CONDOR_HOST)

##  How long are you willing to let daemons try their graceful
##  shutdown methods before they do a hard shutdown? (30 minutes)
#SHUTDOWN_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT	= 1800

##  How much disk space would you like reserved from Condor?  In
##  places where Condor is computing the free disk space on various
##  partitions, it subtracts the amount it really finds by this
##  many megabytes.  (If undefined, defaults to 0).
RESERVED_DISK		= 5

##  If your machine is running AFS and the AFS cache lives on the same
##  partition as the other Condor directories, and you want Condor to
##  reserve the space that your AFS cache is configured to use, set
##  this to true.
#RESERVE_AFS_CACHE	= False

##  By default, if a user does not specify "notify_user" in the submit
##  description file, any email Condor sends about that job will go to
##  "username@UID_DOMAIN".  If your machines all share a common UID
##  domain (so that you would set UID_DOMAIN to be the same across all
##  machines in your pool), *BUT* email to user@UID_DOMAIN is *NOT*
##  the right place for Condor to send email for your site, you can
##  define the default domain to use for email.  A common example
##  would be to set EMAIL_DOMAIN to the fully qualified hostname of
##  each machine in your pool, so users submitting jobs from a
##  specific machine would get email sent to user@machine.your.domain,
##  instead of user@your.domain.  In general, you should leave this
##  setting commented out unless two things are true: 1) UID_DOMAIN is
##  set to your domain, not $(FULL_HOSTNAME), and 2) email to
##  user@UID_DOMAIN won't work.
#EMAIL_DOMAIN = $(FULL_HOSTNAME)

##  Should Condor daemons create a UDP command socket (for incoming
##  UDP-based commands) in addition to the TCP command socket?  By
##  default, classified ad updates sent to the collector use UDP, in
##  addition to some keep alive messages and other non-essential
##  communication.  However, in certain situations, it might be
##  desirable to disable the UDP command port (for example, to reduce
##  the number of ports represented by a CCB broker, etc).  If not
##  defined, the UDP command socket is enabled by default, and to
##  modify this, you must restart your Condor daemons. Also, this
##  setting must be defined machine-wide.  For example, setting
##  "STARTD.WANT_UDP_COMMAND_SOCKET = False" while the global setting
##  is "True" will still result in the startd creating a UDP socket.
#WANT_UDP_COMMAND_SOCKET = True

##  If your site needs to use TCP updates to the collector, instead of
##  UDP, you can enable this feature.  HOWEVER, WE DO NOT RECOMMEND
##  THIS FOR MOST SITES!  In general, the only sites that might want
##  this feature are pools made up of machines connected via a
##  wide-area network where UDP packets are frequently or always
##  dropped.  If you enable this feature, you *MUST* turn on the
##  COLLECTOR_SOCKET_CACHE_SIZE setting at your collector, and each
##  entry in the socket cache uses another file descriptor.  If not
##  defined, this feature is disabled by default.
#UPDATE_COLLECTOR_WITH_TCP = True

## HIGHPORT and LOWPORT let you set the range of ports that Condor
## will use. This may be useful if you are behind a firewall. By
## default, Condor uses port 9618 for the collector, 9614 for the
## negotiator, and system-assigned (apparently random) ports for
## everything else. HIGHPORT and LOWPORT only affect these
## system-assigned ports, but will restrict them to the range you
## specify here. If you want to change the well-known ports for the
## collector or negotiator, see COLLECTOR_HOST or NEGOTIATOR_HOST.
## Note that both LOWPORT and HIGHPORT must be at least 1024 if you
## are not starting your daemons as root.  You may also specify
## different port ranges for incoming and outgoing connections by
## using IN_HIGHPORT/IN_LOWPORT and OUT_HIGHPORT/OUT_LOWPORT.
#HIGHPORT = 9700 
#LOWPORT = 9600

##  If a daemon doesn't respond for too long, do you want go generate
##  a core file?  This basically controls the type of the signal
##  sent to the child process, and mostly affects the Condor Master

##  the exponent used to determine how long to wait before starting
##  the daemon again:
#MASTER_BACKOFF_FACTOR		= 2.0

##  What's the maximum amount of time you want the master to wait
##  between attempts to start a given daemon?  (With 2.0 as the
##  MASTER_BACKOFF_FACTOR, you'd hit 1 hour in 12 restarts...)
#MASTER_BACKOFF_CEILING		= 3600

##  How long should a daemon run without crashing before we consider
##  it "recovered".  Once a daemon has recovered, we reset the number
##  of restarts so the exponential back off stuff goes back to normal.

##  When a machine unclaimed, when should it run benchmarks?
##  LastBenchmark is initialized to 0, so this expression says as soon
##  as we're unclaimed, run the benchmarks.  Thereafter, if we're
##  unclaimed and it's been at least 4 hours since we ran the last
##  benchmarks, run them again.  The startd keeps a weighted average

##  When the startd does benchmarks, which set of benchmarks should we

##  What's the max "load" of all running benchmarks?  With the default

#  KFLOPS (clinpack) benchmark: load 1.0
benchmarks_kflops_executable = $(LIBEXEC)/condor_kflops
benchmarks_kflops_job_load = 1.0


##  Normally, when the startd is computing the idle time of all the
##  users of the machine (both local and remote), it checks the utmp
##  file to find all the currently active ttys, and only checks access
##  time of the devices associated with active logins.  Unfortunately,
##  on some systems, utmp is unreliable, and the startd might miss
##  keyboard activity by doing this.  So, if your utmp is unreliable,
##  set this setting to True and the startd will check the access time
##  on all tty and pty devices.
#STARTD_HAS_BAD_UTMP = False

##  This entry allows the startd to monitor console (keyboard and
##  mouse) activity by checking the access times on special files in
##  /dev.  Activity on these files shows up as "ConsoleIdle" time in
##  the startd's ClassAd.  Just give a comma-separated list of the
##  names of devices you want considered the console, without the
##  "/dev/" portion of the pathname.
#CONSOLE_DEVICES = mouse, console


##  The STARTD_ATTRS (and legacy STARTD_EXPRS) entry allows you to
##  have the startd advertise arbitrary attributes from the config
##  file in its ClassAd.  Give the comma-separated list of entries
##  from the config file you want in the startd ClassAd.
##  NOTE: because of the different syntax of the config file and
##  ClassAds, you might have to do a little extra work to get a given
##  entry into the ClassAd.  In particular, ClassAds require double
##  quotes (") around your strings.  Numeric values can go in
##  directly, as can boolean expressions.  For example, if you wanted
##  the startd to advertise its list of console devices, when it's
##  configured to run benchmarks, and how often it sends updates to
##  the central manager, you'd have to define the following helper
##  macro:
#MY_CONSOLE_DEVICES = "$(CONSOLE_DEVICES)"
##  Note: this must come before you define STARTD_ATTRS because macros
##  must be defined before you use them in other macros or
##  expressions.
##  Then, you'd set the STARTD_ATTRS setting to this:
#STARTD_ATTRS = MY_CONSOLE_DEVICES, RunBenchmarks, UPDATE_INTERVAL
##
##  STARTD_ATTRS can also be defined on a per-slot basis.  The startd
##  builds the list of attributes to advertise by combining the lists
##  in this order: STARTD_ATTRS, SLOTx_STARTD_ATTRS.  In the below
##  example, the startd ad for slot1 will have the value for
##  favorite_color, favorite_season, and favorite_movie, and slot2
##  will have favorite_color, favorite_season, and favorite_song.
##
#STARTD_ATTRS = favorite_color, favorite_season
#SLOT1_STARTD_ATTRS = favorite_movie
#SLOT2_STARTD_ATTRS = favorite_song
##
##  Attributes in the STARTD_ATTRS list can also be on a per-slot basis.
##  For example, the following configuration:
##
#favorite_color = "blue"
#favorite_season = "spring"
#SLOT2_favorite_color = "green"
#SLOT3_favorite_season = "summer"
#STARTD_ATTRS = favorite_color, favorite_season
##
##  will result in the following attributes in the slot classified
##  ads:
##
## slot1 - favorite_color = "blue"; favorite_season = "spring"
## slot2 - favorite_color = "green"; favorite_season = "spring"
## slot3 - favorite_color = "blue"; favorite_season = "summer"
##
##  Finally, the recommended default value for this setting, is to
##  publish the COLLECTOR_HOST setting as a string.  This can be
##  useful using the "$$(COLLECTOR_HOST)" syntax in the submit file
##  for jobs to know (for example, via their environment) what pool
##  they're running in.
COLLECTOR_HOST_STRING = "$(COLLECTOR_HOST)"
STARTD_ATTRS = COLLECTOR_HOST_STRING

##  When the startd is claimed by a remote user, it can also advertise
##  arbitrary attributes from the ClassAd of the job its working on.
##  Just list the attribute names you want advertised.  
##  Note: since this is already a ClassAd, you don't have to do
##  anything funny with strings, etc.  This feature can be turned off
##  by commenting out this setting (there is no default).
STARTD_JOB_EXPRS = ImageSize, ExecutableSize, JobUniverse, NiceUser

##  If you want to "lie" to Condor about how many CPUs your machine
##  has, you can use this setting to override Condor's automatic
##  computation.  If you modify this, you must restart the startd for
##  the change to take effect (a simple condor_reconfig will not do).
##  Please read the section on "condor_startd Configuration File
##  Macros" in the Condor Administrators Manual for a further
##  discussion of this setting.  Its use is not recommended.  This
##  must be an integer ("N" isn't a valid setting, that's just used to
##  represent the default).
#NUM_CPUS = N

##  If you never want Condor to detect more the "N" CPUs, uncomment this
##  line out. You must restart the startd for this setting to take 
##  effect. If set to 0 or a negative number, it is ignored. 
##  By default, it is ignored. Otherwise, it must be a positive  
##  integer ("N" isn't a valid setting, that's just used to
##  represent the default).
#MAX_NUM_CPUS = N

##  Normally, Condor will automatically detect the amount of physical
##  memory available on your machine.  Define MEMORY to tell Condor
##  how much physical memory (in MB) your machine has, overriding the
##  value Condor computes automatically.  For example:
#MEMORY = 128

##  How much memory would you like reserved from Condor?  By default,
##  Condor considers all the physical memory of your machine as
##  available to be used by Condor jobs.  If RESERVED_MEMORY is
##  defined, Condor subtracts it from the amount of memory it
##  advertises as available.
#RESERVED_MEMORY = 0

######
##  SMP startd settings
##
##  By default, Condor will evenly divide the resources in an SMP
##  machine (such as RAM, swap space and disk space) among all the
##  CPUs, and advertise each CPU as its own slot with an even share of
##  the system resources.  If you want something other than this,
##  there are a few options available to you.  Please read the section
##  on "Configuring The Startd for SMP Machines" in the Condor
##  Administrator's Manual for full details.  The various settings are
##  only briefly listed and described here.
######

##  The maximum number of different slot types.
#MAX_SLOT_TYPES = 10

##  Use this setting to define your own slot types.  This
##  allows you to divide system resources unevenly among your CPUs.
##  You must use a different setting for each different type you
##  define.  The "<N>" in the name of the macro listed below must be
##  an integer from 1 to MAX_SLOT_TYPES (defined above),
##  and you use this number to refer to your type.  There are many
##  different formats these settings can take, so be sure to refer to
##  the section on "Configuring The Startd for SMP Machines" in the
##  Condor Administrator's Manual for full details.  In particular,
##  read the section titled "Defining Slot Types" to help
##  understand this setting.  If you modify any of these settings, you
##  must restart the condor_start for the change to take effect.
#SLOT_TYPE_<N> = 1/4
#SLOT_TYPE_<N> = cpus=1, ram=25%, swap=1/4, disk=1/4
#  For example:
#SLOT_TYPE_1 = 1/8
#SLOT_TYPE_2 = 1/4

##  If you define your own slot types, you must specify how
##  many slots of each type you wish to advertise.  You do
##  this with the setting below, replacing the "<N>" with the
##  corresponding integer you used to define the type above.  You can
##  change the number of a given type being advertised at run-time,
##  with a simple condor_reconfig.  
#NUM_SLOTS_TYPE_<N> = M
#  For example:
#NUM_SLOTS_TYPE_1 = 6
#NUM_SLOTS_TYPE_2 = 1

##  The number of evenly-divided slots you want Condor to
##  report to your pool (if less than the total number of CPUs).  This
##  setting is only considered if the "type" settings described above
##  are not in use.  By default, all CPUs are reported.  This setting
##  must be an integer ("N" isn't a valid setting, that's just used to
##  represent the default).
#NUM_SLOTS = N

##  How many of the slots the startd is representing should
##  be "connected" to the console (in other words, notice when there's
##  console activity)?  This defaults to all slots (N in a
##  machine with N CPUs).  This must be an integer ("N" isn't a valid
##  setting, that's just used to represent the default).
#SLOTS_CONNECTED_TO_CONSOLE = N

##  How many of the slots the startd is representing should
##  be "connected" to the keyboard (for remote tty activity, as well
##  as console activity).  Defaults to 1.
#SLOTS_CONNECTED_TO_KEYBOARD = 1

##  If there are slots that aren't connected to the
##  keyboard or the console (see the above two settings), the
##  corresponding idle time reported will be the time since the startd
##  was spawned, plus the value of this parameter.  It defaults to 20
##  minutes.  We do this because, if the slot is configured
##  not to care about keyboard activity, we want it to be available to
##  Condor jobs as soon as the startd starts up, instead of having to
##  wait for 15 minutes or more (which is the default time a machine
##  must be idle before Condor will start a job).  If you don't want
##  this boost, just set the value to 0.  If you change your START
##  expression to require more than 15 minutes before a job starts,
##  but you still want jobs to start right away on some of your SMP
##  nodes, just increase this parameter.
#DISCONNECTED_KEYBOARD_IDLE_BOOST = 1200

######
##  Settings for computing optional resource availability statistics:
######
##  If STARTD_COMPUTE_AVAIL_STATS = True, the startd will compute
##  statistics about resource availability to be included in the
##  classad(s) sent to the collector describing the resource(s) the
##  startd manages.  The following attributes will always be included
##  in the resource classad(s) if STARTD_COMPUTE_AVAIL_STATS = True:
##    AvailTime = What proportion of the time (between 0.0 and 1.0)
##      has this resource been in a state other than "Owner"?
##    LastAvailInterval = What was the duration (in seconds) of the
##      last period between "Owner" states?
##  The following attributes will also be included if the resource is
##  not in the "Owner" state:
##    AvailSince = At what time did the resource last leave the
##      "Owner" state?  Measured in the number of seconds since the
##      epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
##    AvailTimeEstimate = Based on past history, this is an estimate
##      of how long the current period between "Owner" states will
##      last.
#STARTD_COMPUTE_AVAIL_STATS = False

##  If STARTD_COMPUTE_AVAIL_STATS = True, STARTD_AVAIL_CONFIDENCE sets
##  the confidence level of the AvailTimeEstimate.  By default, the
##  estimate is based on the 80th percentile of past values.
#STARTD_AVAIL_CONFIDENCE = 0.8

##  STARTD_MAX_AVAIL_PERIOD_SAMPLES limits the number of samples of
##  past available intervals stored by the startd to limit memory and
##  disk consumption.  Each sample requires 4 bytes of memory and
##  approximately 10 bytes of disk space.
#STARTD_MAX_AVAIL_PERIOD_SAMPLES = 100

##	CKPT_PROBE is the location of a program which computes aspects of the
##	CheckpointPlatform classad attribute. By default the location of this
##	executable will be here: $(LIBEXEC)/condor_ckpt_probe
CKPT_PROBE = $(LIBEXEC)/condor_ckpt_probe

SCHEDD_ADDRESS_FILE	= $(SPOOL)/.schedd_address

##  Additionally, a daemon may store its ClassAd on the local filesystem

## The condor_schedd can renice scheduler universe processes
## (e.g. DAGMan) on your submit machines.  How "nice" do you want the
## scheduler universe processes? (1-19).  The higher the number, the
## lower priority the processes have.
# SCHED_UNIV_RENICE_INCREMENT = 0

##  By default, when the schedd fails to start an idle job, it will
##  not try to start any other idle jobs in the same cluster during
##  that negotiation cycle.  This makes negotiation much more
##  efficient for large job clusters.  However, in some cases other
##  jobs in the cluster can be started even though an earlier job
##  can't.  For example, the jobs' requirements may differ, because of
##  different disk space, memory, or operating system requirements.
##  Or, machines may be willing to run only some jobs in the cluster,
##  because their requirements reference the jobs' virtual memory size
##  or other attribute.  Setting NEGOTIATE_ALL_JOBS_IN_CLUSTER to True
##  will force the schedd to try to start all idle jobs in each
##  negotiation cycle.  This will make negotiation cycles last longer,
##  but it will ensure that all jobs that can be started will be
##  started.
#NEGOTIATE_ALL_JOBS_IN_CLUSTER = False

## This setting controls how often, in seconds, the schedd considers

##  If you would like this machine to be able to run Java jobs,
##  then set JAVA to the path of your JVM binary.  If you are not
##  interested in Java, there is no harm in leaving this entry
##  empty or incorrect.

JAVA = /usr/bin/java

## JAVA_CLASSPATH_DEFAULT gives the default set of paths in which
## Java classes are to be found.  Each path is separated by spaces.
## If your JVM needs to be informed of additional directories, add
## them here.  However, do not remove the existing entries, as Condor
## needs them.

JAVA_CLASSPATH_DEFAULT = $(LIB) $(LIB)/scimark2lib.jar .

##  JAVA_CLASSPATH_ARGUMENT describes the command-line parameter
##  used to introduce a new classpath:

JAVA_CLASSPATH_ARGUMENT = -classpath

##  JAVA_CLASSPATH_SEPARATOR describes the character used to mark
##  one path element from another:

JAVA_CLASSPATH_SEPARATOR = :

##  JAVA_BENCHMARK_TIME describes the number of seconds for which
##  to run Java benchmarks.  A longer time yields a more accurate
##  benchmark, but consumes more otherwise useful CPU time.
##  If this time is zero or undefined, no Java benchmarks will be run.

## Gridmanager will use for it's logfile. Our suggestion is to create a

##--------------------------------------------------------------------

## The number of seconds between status update requests. You can make 
## this short (5 seconds) if you want Condor to respond quickly to 
## instances as they terminate, or you can make it long (300 seconds = 5 
## minutes) if you know your instances will run for awhile and don't 
## mind delay between when they stop and when Condor responds to them 
## stopping.
GRIDMANAGER_JOB_PROBE_INTERVAL = 300

## For grid-type gt2 jobs (pre-WS GRAM), limit the number of jobmanager
## processes the gridmanager will let run on the headnode. Letting too
## many jobmanagers run causes severe load on the headnode.
GRIDMANAGER_MAX_JOBMANAGERS_PER_RESOURCE = 10

## If we're talking to a Globus 2.0 resource, Condor-G will use the new
## version of the GRAM protocol. The first option is how often to check the

## proxy, it will restart itself and use the new proxy for all future 
## jobs launched. In seconds,  and defaults to 10 minutes

#GRDIMANAGER_MINIMUM_PROXY_TIME  = 180

## Condor requires that each submitted job be designated to run under a
## particular "universe". 
##
## If no universe is specified in the submit file, Condor must pick one
## for the job to use. By default, it chooses the "vanilla" universe. 
## The default can be overridden in the config file with the DEFAULT_UNIVERSE
## setting, which is a string to insert into a job submit description if the
## job does not try and define it's own universe
##
#DEFAULT_UNIVERSE = vanilla

#
# The Cred_min_time_left is the first-pass at making sure that Condor-G
# does not submit your job without it having enough time left for the 
# job to finish. For example, if you have a job that runs for 20 minutes, and
# you might spend 40 minutes in the queue, it's a bad idea to submit with less
# than an hour left before your proxy expires.

## Want to support networking for VM universe?
## Default value is FALSE

## In default, the number of possible virtual machines is same as
## NUM_CPUS.
## Since too many virtual machines can cause the system to be too slow
## and lead to unexpected problems, limit the number of running 
## virtual machines on this machine with
#VM_MAX_NUMBER = 2

## When a VM universe job is started, a status command is sent
## to the VM-GAHP to see if the job is finished.
## If the interval between checks is too short, it will consume 
## too much of the CPU. If the VM-GAHP fails to get status 5 times in a row, 
## an error will be reported to startd, and then startd will check 
## the availability of VM universe.
## Default value is 60 seconds and minimum value is 30 seconds
#VM_STATUS_INTERVAL = 60

## How long will we wait for a request sent to the VM-GAHP to be completed?

## to the startd, and then the startd will check 
## the availability of vm universe.  Default value is 5 minutes.

## Usually, when we suspend a VM, the memory being used by the VM

## However, when we use soft suspend, neither saving nor memory freeing
## will occur.
## For VMware, we send SIGSTOP to a process for VM in order to 
## stop the VM temporarily and send SIGCONT to resume the VM.
## For Xen, we pause CPU. Pausing CPU doesn't save the memory of VM 
## into a file. It only stops the execution of a VM temporarily.

## If Condor runs as root and a job comes from a different UID domain, 
## Condor generally uses "nobody", unless SLOTx_USER is defined. 
## If "VM_UNIV_NOBODY_USER" is defined, a VM universe job will run 
## as the user defined in "VM_UNIV_NOBODY_USER" instead of "nobody". 
##
## Notice: In VMware VM universe, "nobody" can not create a VMware VM. 
## So we need to define "VM_UNIV_NOBODY_USER" with a regular user. 
## For VMware, the user defined in "VM_UNIV_NOBODY_USER" must have a
## home directory.  So SOFT_UID_DOMAIN doesn't work for VMware VM universe job.
## If neither "VM_UNIV_NOBODY_USER" nor "SLOTx_VMUSER"/"SLOTx_USER" is defined, 
## VMware VM universe job will run as "condor" instead of "nobody".
## As a result, the preference of local users for a VMware VM universe job
## which comes from the different UID domain is 
## "VM_UNIV_NOBODY_USER" -> "SLOTx_VMUSER" -> "SLOTx_USER" -> "condor". 
#VM_UNIV_NOBODY_USER = login name of a user who has home directory

## If Condor runs as root and "ALWAYS_VM_UNIV_USE_NOBODY" is set to TRUE,

## The location for hadoop installation directory. The default location
## is under 'libexec' directory. The directory pointed by HDFS_HOME 
## should contain a lib folder that contains all the required Jars necessary
## to run HDFS name and data nodes. 
#HDFS_HOME = $(RELEASE_DIR)/libexec/hdfs

## The host and port for hadoop's name node. If this machine is the
## name node (see HDFS_SERVICES) then the specified port will be used
## to run name node. 
HDFS_NAMENODE = hdfs://example.com:9000
HDFS_NAMENODE_WEB = example.com:8000

HDFS_BACKUPNODE = hdfs://example.com:50100

## You need to pick one machine as name node by setting this parameter
## to HDFS_NAMENODE. The remaining machines in a storage cluster will
## act as data nodes (HDFS_DATANODE).
HDFS_NODETYPE = HDFS_DATANODE

## If machine is selected to be NameNode then by a role should defined.
## If it selected to be DataNode then this parameter is ignored.
## Available options:
## ACTIVE: Active NameNode role (default value)
## BACKUP: Always synchronized with the active NameNode state, thus 
##         creating a backup of the namespace. Currently the NameNode
##         supports one Backup node at a time.
## CHECKPOINT: Periodically creates checkpoints of the namespace. 
HDFS_NAMENODE_ROLE = ACTIVE

## The two set of directories that are required by HDFS are for name 
## node (HDFS_NAMENODE_DIR) and data node (HDFS_DATANODE_DIR). The 
## directory for name node is only required for a machine running 
## name node service and  is used to store critical meta data for 
## files. The data node needs its directory to store file blocks and 
## their replicas.
HDFS_NAMENODE_DIR = /tmp/hadoop_name
HDFS_DATANODE_DIR = /scratch/tmp/hadoop_data

## Unlike name node address settings (HDFS_NAMENODE), that needs to be 
## well known across the storage cluster, data node can run on any 
## arbitrary port of given host.

## be used to override these settings. Read the Condor manual for

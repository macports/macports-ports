description             The MUlticomponent Thermodynamic And Transport library for IONized gases in C++
long_description        Mutation++ is an open-source library originally \
                        developed at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, designed to couple \
                        with conventional computational fluid dynamics codes to provide thermodynamic, \
                        transport, chemistry, and energy transfer properties associated with subsonic \
                        to hypersonic flows.

# This patch is needed in order to avoid that cmake uses `FindEigen3.cmake`
# instead of the Eigen3Config.cmake that provides the right target

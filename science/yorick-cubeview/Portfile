description         3D FITS data viewer specialized in spectro-imaging
long_description    Cubeview is a viewer for 3D data store in FITS files, a \
                    file format extensively used among astronomers. It is \
                    specialized in displaying spectro-imaging data but can be \
                    used to do basic visualization on any FITS file containing \
                    a 3D array. Cubeview features a stand-alone graphical user \
                    interface which adheres to the GTK+ look-and-feel. Being \
                    written (mostly) in Yorick, it is inherently scriptable. A \
                    system of hooks allows custom actions to be repeated \
                    automatically when certain events occur.

description         A Monte Carlo program for the accurate simulation of X-ray imaging and \
                    spectroscopy experiments in heterogeneous samples

long_description    XRMC is a Monte Carlo program for the accurate simulation \
                    of X-ray imaging and spectroscopy experiments in heterogeneous \
                    samples. The use of the Monte Carlo method makes the code \
                    suitable for the detailed simulation of complex experiments \
                    on generic samples. Variance reduction techniques are used \
                    to reduce the computational time considerably compared to \
                    general-purpose Monte Carlo programs. The program is written in \
                    C++ and has been tested on Linux, Mac OS X and MS Windows platforms.

# COLLAPSE is a new clause that has been added in OpenMP 3.0, which is supported only in GCC 4.4 and later
# so gcc 4.2 will give errors like this:
# detector.cpp:187: error: expected '#pragma omp' clause before 'collapse'
# detector.cpp:279: error: expected '#pragma omp' clause before 'collapse'
# llvm-gcc-4.2 is fine though because the configure script correctly detects that OpenMP is not supported; same for default clang

description         Message Passing Interface (MPI) Library

long_description    MPICH is a high-performance and widely portable\
                    implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) \
                    standard (MPI-1, MPI-2 and MPI-3). The goals of MPICH are:\
                    (1) to provide an MPI implementation that efficiently\
                    supports different computation and communication platforms\
                    including commodity clusters (desktop systems,\
                    shared-memory systems, multicore architectures), high-speed\
                    networks (10 Gigabit Ethernet, InfiniBand, Myrinet,\
                    Quadrics) and proprietary high-end computing systems (Blue\
                    Gene, Cray) and (2) to enable cutting-edge research in MPI\
                    through an easy-to-extend modular framework for other\
                    derived implementations. \
                    \n\n\
                    The mpich3 port follows the mpich 3.x line, and is the\
                    successor to the mpich2 package. Starting with the major\
                    release in November 2012, the project is renamed back to\
                    MPICH (from MPICH2) with a version number of 3.0.

description         OpenCSG is a library that does image-based CSG rendering using OpenGL
long_description    CSG is short for Constructive Solid Geometry and denotes an approach \
                    to model complex 3D-shapes using simpler ones. I.e., two shapes can be \
                    combined by taking the union of them, by intersecting them, or by \
                    subtracting one shape of the other. The most basic shapes, which are \
                    not result of such a CSG operation, are called primitives. Primitives \
                    must be solid, i.e., they must have a clearly defined interior and \
                    exterior. By construction, a CSG shape is also solid then.

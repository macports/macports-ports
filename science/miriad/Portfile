description      MIRIAD, an analysis package for radio astronomical data
long_description MIRIAD, the Multichannel Imaging, Reconstruction, Analysis, \
                 and Display package, is a suite of tools for analyzing radio \
                 astronomical observations, from raw data to imaging.

# The license to MIRIAD is somewhat indeterminate, since it has had
# many contributors working at many academic institutions with various
# copyright assignment and licensing policies. It's pretty important
# to straighten this out at some point.

# Versioning information. Miriad releases are very infrequent, so
# our ports will be based on distributions made from CVS snapshots.
# We add a sub-version number based on the snapshot date to
# distinguish things.

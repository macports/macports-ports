        This port is kept up with the VOLK-GNSS-SDR GIT master branch, which is typically updated daily to weekly.  This version of VOLK-GNSS-SDR generally contains fixes and new features that will be incorporated in an upcoming release, and compiles against the gnss-sdr-devel and gnuradio-devel ports.  This port may or not compile or function correctly, as it represents a work in progress.  If it does not work, check back in a few days.  Or try deactivating the currently active gnss-sdr and gnuradio ports, cleaning any current builds, and trying again.

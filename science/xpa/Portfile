description         The XPA messaging system provides seamless communication \
    between many kinds of Unix programs, including X programs and Tcl/Tk \
    programs.

long_description    XPA provides an easy way for users to communicate with \
    XPA-enabled programs by executing XPA client commands in the shell or \
    by utilizing such commands in scripts.  Because XPA works both at the \
    programming level and the shell level, it is a powerful tool for unifying \
    any analysis environment: users and programmers have great flexibility in \
    choosing the best level or levels at which to access XPA services, and \
    client access can be extended or modified easily at any time.

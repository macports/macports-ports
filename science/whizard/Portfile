description         Generator of high-energy physics events

long_description    WHIZARD is a program system designed for the efficient \
                    calculation of multi-particle scattering cross sections \
                    and simulated event samples. Tree-level matrix elements \
                    are generated automatically for arbitrary partonic \
                    processes by using the Optimized Matrix Element Generator O'Mega. \
                    Matrix elements obtained by alternative methods (e.g., \
                    including loop corrections) may be interfaced as well. \
                    The program is able to calculate numerically stable signal \
                    and background cross sections and generate unweighted \
                    event samples with reasonable efficiency for processes \
                    with up to eight final-state particles\; more particles are \
                    possible. For more particles, there is the option to generate \
                    processes as decay cascades including complete spin correlations.

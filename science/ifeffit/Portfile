description         IFEFFIT is a program and programming library for analyzing x-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) data.

long_description    ${description} \
                    As its name may suggest, IFEFFIT1 gives an interactive method for fitting XAFS data using calculations \
                    from FEFF, and is based on the fitting program FEFFIT of the UWXAFS3.0 Analysis Package.

# IMPORTANT BUILD NOTES
#
# p5-ifeffit is configured using a Makefile.PL that is generated when ifeffit is built.
# since the paths to the compiler libraries contain compiler version information,
# if the compiler version changes then both ifeffit and p5-ifeffit need to be rebuilt
# so that the Makefile.PL in use contains the correct paths.
#
# if in doubt rebuild everything

pre-configure {
    configure.args-append --with-fortran=${configure.f77}

# this is the final release of ifeffit

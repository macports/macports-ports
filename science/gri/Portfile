description          A scientific graphics programming language
long_description     Gri is a language for scientific graphics programming. \
                     The word "language" is important: Gri is command-driven, \
		     not point/click. \
                     Some users consider Gri similar to LaTeX, since both \
		     provide extensive power in exchange for patience in \
		     learning syntax.\
                     Gri can make x-y graphs, contour graphs, and image \
		     graphs, in PostScript and (someday) SVG formats. \
		     Control is provided over all aspects of drawing, e.g. \
		     line widths, colors, and fonts. A TeX-like syntax \
		     provides common mathematical symbols.

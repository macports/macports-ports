long_description            The Orrery is a digital model of the solar \
                            system, named for the mechanical models of the \
                            same name (often you'll see one with just the \
                            Sun, Earth and Moon, as little balls supported on \
                            wires). The first such was built for the fourth \
                            Earl of Orrery in the 1700s. It includes all nine \
                            planets, some of their satellites, and a few \
                            recent comets. Orrery is a Geomview module.

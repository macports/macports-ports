long_description \
    The netCDF Client Library is an alternative implementation of   \
    Unidata's netCDF 3.6 API. Our version adds the capability to    \
    dereference OPeNDAP URLs. You can substitute our version of     \
    the library when linking your application and then simply pass  \
    an OPeNDAP URL in where you would normally use a file name.

description         A fresh and clean vendor neutral and platform independent SDR support library
long_description    SoapySDR is an open-source generalized C/C++ API and runtime library for interfacing with SDR devices. With SoapySDR, you can instantiate, configure, and stream with an SDR device in a variety of environments. Both osmosdr and uhd devices are available within SoapySDR. In addition, vendors can directly support their hardware using SoapySDR device modules. There are wrappers for both gr-osmosdr, uhd, and gr-uhd to bring an ecosystem of existing applications to SoapySDR devices. And SoapySDR has support for powerful platforms like GNU Radio and Pothos.

description         macromolecular coordinate library
long_description    MMDB is designed to assist developers in working \
                    with macromolecular coordinate files. The library \
                    handles both PDB and mmCIF format files. \
                    The Library also features an internal binary \
                    format, portable between different platforms. This \
                    is achieved at uniformity of the Library's \
                    interface functions, so that there is no \
                    difference in handling different formats. \
                    MMDB provides various high-level tools for working \
                    with coordinate files, including reading and \
                    writing, orthogonal-fractional transforms, \
                    generation of symmetry mates, editing the \
                    molecular structure and more.

notes "
The SSL support in this older Stellarium version may not be able to\
download the star files from various https sites. Until this is fixed\
(if it is fixed) you can download these files manually using wget or curl\
or a similar current downloader.

The list of files that Stellarium attempts to download are stored in:
~/Library/Application Support/Stellarium/log.txt

The star files are downloaded into:
~/Library/Application Support/Stellarium/stars/default/

Note, you must delete the file from a previously failed download attempt if it exists \
to have a successful download using wget. These commands will download \
the first two large star catalogs:

cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Stellarium/stars/default
wget https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium-data/releases/download/stars-2.0/stars_4_1v0_2.cat
wget https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium-data/releases/download/stars-2.0/stars_5_2v0_1.cat

description         A VLSI Layout System

long_description    Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the \
                    1980's at Berkeley. Magic is widely cited as being the \
                    easiest tool to use for circuit layout, even for people \
                    who ultimately rely on commercial tools for their product \
                    design flow.

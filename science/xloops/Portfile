description	A Program for Calculating Feynman Diagrams
long_description	\
		The aim of xloops is to calculate one-particle		\
		irreducible Feynman diagrams with one or two closed	\
		loops for arbitrary processes in the Standard Model	\			of particles and related theories. Results can be	\
		returned both algebraically and numerically.		\
		All necessary tensor integrals are treated for		\
		arbitrary masses and momenta.

#user_notes	Not all of the two loops tests pass yet. The ones that	\
#		do not are commented out.				\
#									\
#		Some of the functions in the cvs version take different	\
#		arguments than are specified in the documentation.	\
#		As always, the source code is your friend in these	\
#		situations.						\
#									\
#		Remember, you must build your programs that include	\
#		the xloop library with the same C++ compiler as was	\
#		used to build xloops (g++ 4.0, most recently).

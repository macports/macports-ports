description         HMMER searches biological sequence databases for \
        homologous sequences.
long_description    HMMER searches biological sequence databases for \
        homologous sequences, using either single sequences or multiple \
        sequence alignments as queries. HMMER implements a technology \
        called "profile hidden Markov models" (profile HMMs). HMMER is \
        the software engine underlying many protein family domain \
        databases and large-scale annotation pipelines, including the \
        Pfam and SMART databases.

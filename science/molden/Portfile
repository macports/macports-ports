description         Molecular graphics visualisation tool
long_description    Molden is a package for displaying Molecular Density from \
                    the Ab Initio packages GAMESS-UK, GAMESS-US and \
                    GAUSSIAN and the Semi-Empirical packages Mopac/Ampac, it \
                    also supports a number of other programs via the Molden Format. \
                    \n\nIn order to keep up support for Molden, proof that \
                    it is being used outside the CMBI is required. \
                    Please register your copy of molden at: \
                    ${homepage}form.html

description         a minimal buy-in FITS library and utility package

long_description    Funtools is a \"minimal buy-in\" FITS library and \
    utility package developed at the the High Energy Astrophysics Division \
    of SAO. The Funtools library provides simplified access to a \
    wide array of file types: standard astronomical FITS images and binary \
    tables, raw arrays and binary event lists, and even tables of ASCII \
    column data. A sophisticated region filtering library (compatible with \
    ds9) filters images and tables using boolean operations between geometric \
    shapes, support world coordinates, etc. Funtools also supports advanced \
    capabilities such as optimized data searching using index files.\
    The main goal of the Funtools project has been to develop a minimal \
    buy-in FITS library for researchers who are occasional (but serious) \
    coders. In this case, minimal buy-in means easy to learn, easy to \
    use, and easy to re-learn next month.

description         A tool for generating atomic pseudopotentials within a Density-Functional Theory framework.
long_description    APE (Atomic Pseudopotentials Engine) is a computer package designed to generate \
                    and test norm-conserving pseudo-potentials within Density Functional Theory. \
                    The generated pseudo-potentials can be either non-relativistic, scalar \
                    relativistic or fully relativistic and can explicitly include \
                    semi-core states. A wide range of exchange-correlation functionals is included. \
                    APE can generate pseudopotential files for use with SIESTA, Abinit, Octopus, \
                    and Quantum Espresso.

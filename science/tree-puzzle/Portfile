long_description \
    TREE-PUZZLE is a computer program to reconstruct phylogenetic trees \
    from molecular sequence data by maximum likelihood. It implements a \
    fast tree search algorithm, quartet puzzling, that allows analysis \
    of large data sets and automatically assigns estimations of support \
    to each internal branch.

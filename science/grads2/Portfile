long_description   \
    The Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) is an interactive     \
    desktop tool that is used for easy access, manipulation, and       \
    visualization of earth science data. The format of the data may    \
    be either binary, GRIB, NetCDF, or HDF-SDS (Scientific Data Sets). \
    GrADS has been implemented worldwide on a variety of commonly used \
    operating systems and is freely distributed over the Internet.

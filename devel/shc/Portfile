description         Shell Script Compiler
long_description    SHC is a generic shell script compiler. It takes a script,\
    which is specified on the command line and produces C source code. \
    The generated source code is then compiled and linked to produce a stripped\
    binary. The compiled binary will still be dependent on the shell specified \
    in the first line of the shell code (i.e shebang: #!/bin/sh or such), \
    thus shc does not create completely independent binaries. \
    shc itself is not a compiler such as cc, it rather encodes and encrypts \
    a shell script and generates C source code with the added expiration\
    capability. It then uses the system compiler to compile a stripped binary \
    which behaves exactly like the original script. Upon execution, the \
    compiled binary will decrypt and execute the code with the shells' -c \
    option.

description			An open-source web application framework that leverages the Groovy language
long_description	Grails aims to bring the "coding by convention" paradigm to Groovy. \
					It's an open-source web application framework that leverages the Groovy \
					language and complements Java Web development. \
					You can use Grails as a standalone development environment that hides all \
					configuration details or integrate your Java business logic. \
					Grails aims to make development as simple as possible and hence \
					should appeal to a wide range of developers not just those from the Java community.

description         A fast, type-safe C++ Entity-Component system

long_description    \
    {*}${description}. Entity Component Systems \(ECS\) are a form of \
    decomposition that completely decouples entity logic and data from the \
    entity \"objects\" themselves. The Evolve your Hierarchy article provides \
    a solid overview of EC systems and why you should use them. EntityX is an \
    EC system that uses C++11 features to provide type-safe component \
    management, event delivery, etc. It was built during the creation of a 2D \
    space shooter.

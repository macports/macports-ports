description         A custom Amazon ECS CLI that eases up the cluster setup \
                    process.
long_description    \
                    The Amazon ECS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a command \
                    line interface for Amazon Elastic Container Service \
                    (Amazon ECS) that provides high-level commands to simplify \
                    creating, updating, and monitoring clusters and tasks from \
                    a local development environment.  The Amazon ECS CLI \
                    supports Docker Compose, a popular open-source tool for \
                    defining and running multi-container applications. Use the \
                    CLI as part of your everyday development and testing cycle \
                    as an alternative to the AWS Management Console.

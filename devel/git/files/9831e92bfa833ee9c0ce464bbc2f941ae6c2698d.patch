Subject: [PATCH 1/5] http-push: stop using name_path

The graph traversal code here passes along a name_path to
build up the pathname at which we find each blob. But we
never actually do anything with the resulting names, making
it a waste of code and memory.

This usage came in aa1dbc9 (Update http-push functionality,
2006-03-07), and originally the result was passed to
"add_object" (which stored it, but didn't really use it,
either). But we stopped using that function in 1f1e895 (Add
"named object array" concept, 2006-06-19) in favor of
storing just the objects themselves.

Moreover, the generation of the name in process_tree() is
buggy. It sticks "name" onto the end of the name_path linked
list, and then passes it down again as it recurses (instead
of "entry.path"). So it's a good thing this was unused, as
the resulting path for "a/b/c/d" would end up as "a/a/a/a".

Subject: [PATCH 2/5] show_object_with_name: simplify by using path_name()

When "git rev-list" shows an object with its associated path
name, it does so by walking the name_path linked list and
printing each component (stopping at any embedded NULs or
newlines).

We'd like to eventually get rid of name_path entirely in
favor of a single buffer, and dropping this custom printing
code is part of that. As a first step, let's use path_name()
to format the list into a single buffer, and print that.
This is strictly less efficient than the original, but it's
a temporary step in the refactoring; our end game will be to
get the fully formatted name in the first place.

Subject: [PATCH 3/5] list-objects: convert name_path to a strbuf

The "struct name_path" data is examined in only two places:
we generate it in process_tree(), and we convert it to a
single string in path_name(). Everyone else just passes it
through to those functions.

We can further note that process_tree() already keeps a
single strbuf with the leading tree path, for use with
tree_entry_interesting().

Instead of building a separate name_path linked list, let's
just use the one we already build in "base". This reduces
the amount of code (especially tricky code in path_name()
which did not check for integer overflows caused by deep
or large pathnames).

It is also more efficient in some instances.  Any time we
were using tree_entry_interesting, we were building up the
strbuf anyway, so this is an immediate and obvious win
there. In cases where we were not, we trade off storing
"pathname/" in a strbuf on the heap for each level of the
path, instead of two pointers and an int on the stack (with
one pointer into the tree object). On a 64-bit system, the
latter is 20 bytes; so if path components are less than that
on average, this has lower peak memory usage.  In practice
it probably doesn't matter either way; we are already
holding in memory all of the tree objects leading up to each
pathname, and for normal-depth pathnames, we are only
talking about hundreds of bytes.

This patch leaves "struct name_path" as a thin wrapper
around the strbuf, to avoid disrupting callbacks. We should
fix them, but leaving it out makes this diff easier to view.

Subject: [PATCH 4/5] list-objects: drop name_path entirely

In the previous commit, we left name_path as a thin wrapper
around a strbuf. This patch drops it entirely. As a result,
every show_object_fn callback needs to be adjusted. However,
none of their code needs to be changed at all, because the
only use was to pass it to path_name(), which now handles
the bare strbuf.

Subject: [PATCH 5/5] list-objects: pass full pathname to callbacks

When we find a blob at "a/b/c", we currently pass this to
our show_object_fn callbacks as two components: "a/b/" and
"c". Callbacks which want the full value then call
path_name(), which concatenates the two. But this is an
inefficient interface; the path is a strbuf, and we could
simply append "c" to it temporarily, then roll back the
length, without creating a new copy.

So we could improve this by teaching the callsites of
path_name() this trick (and there are only 3). But we can
also notice that no callback actually cares about the
broken-down representation, and simply pass each callback
the full path "a/b/c" as a string. The callback code becomes
even simpler, then, as we do not have to worry about freeing
an allocated buffer, nor rolling back our modification to
the strbuf.

This is theoretically less efficient, as some callbacks
would not bother to format the final path component. But in
practice this is not measurable. Since we use the same
strbuf over and over, our work to grow it is amortized, and
we really only pay to memcpy a few bytes.

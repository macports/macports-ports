+.SH "DESCRIPTION"
+
+.sp
+Subtrees allow subprojects to be included within a subdirectory of the main project, optionally including the subproject\(cqs entire history\&.
+.sp
+For example, you could include the source code for a library as a subdirectory of your application\&.
+.sp
+Subtrees are not to be confused with submodules, which are meant for the same task\&. Unlike submodules, subtrees do not need any special constructions (like \&.gitmodule files or gitlinks) be present in your repository, and do not force end\-users of your repository to do anything special or to understand how subtrees work\&. A subtree is just a subdirectory that can be committed to, branched, and merged along with your project in any way you want\&.
+.sp
+They are also not to be confused with using the subtree merge strategy\&. The main difference is that, besides merging the other project as a subdirectory, you can also extract the entire history of a subdirectory from your project and make it into a standalone project\&. Unlike the subtree merge strategy you can alternate back and forth between these two operations\&. If the standalone library gets updated, you can automatically merge the changes into your project; if you update the library inside your project, you can "split" the changes back out again and merge them back into the library project\&.
+.sp
+For example, if a library you made for one application ends up being useful elsewhere, you can extract its entire history and publish that as its own git repository, without accidentally intermingling the history of your application project\&.

+.sp
+In order to keep your commit messages clean, we recommend that people split their commits between the subtrees and the main project as much as possible\&. That is, if you make a change that affects both the library and the main application, commit it in two pieces\&. That way, when you split the library commits out later, their descriptions will still make sense\&. But if this isn\(cqt important to you, it\(cqs not \fBnecessary\fR\&. git subtree will simply leave out the non\-library\-related parts of the commit when it splits it out into the subproject later\&.

+.SH "COMMANDS"
+
+
+
+.PP
+add
+.RS 4
+
+
+
+Create the <prefix> subtree by importing its contents from the given <commit> or <repository> and remote <ref>\&. A new commit is created automatically, joining the imported project\(cqs history with your own\&. With
+\fI\-\-squash\fR, imports only a single commit from the subproject, rather than its entire history\&.
+
+.RE
+.PP
+merge
+.RS 4
+
+
+
+Merge recent changes up to <commit> into the <prefix> subtree\&. As with normal
+\fIgit merge\fR, this doesn\(cqt remove your own local changes; it just merges those changes into the latest <commit>\&. With
+\fI\-\-squash\fR, creates only one commit that contains all the changes, rather than merging in the entire history\&.
+.sp
+
+If you use
+\fI\-\-squash\fR, the merge direction doesn\(cqt always have to be forward; you can use this command to go back in time from v2\&.5 to v2\&.4, for example\&. If your merge introduces a conflict, you can resolve it in the usual ways\&.
+
+.RE
+.PP
+pull
+.RS 4
+
+
+
+Exactly like
+\fImerge\fR, but parallels
+\fIgit pull\fR
+in that it fetches the given ref from the specified remote repository\&.
+
+.RE
+.PP
+push
+.RS 4
+
+
+
+Does a
+\fIsplit\fR
+(see below) using the <prefix> supplied and then does a
+\fIgit push\fR
+to push the result to the repository and ref\&. This can be used to push your subtree to different branches of the remote repository\&.
+
+.RE
+.PP
+split
+.RS 4
+
+
+
+Extract a new, synthetic project history from the history of the <prefix> subtree\&. The new history includes only the commits (including merges) that affected <prefix>, and each of those commits now has the contents of <prefix> at the root of the project instead of in a subdirectory\&. Thus, the newly created history is suitable for export as a separate git repository\&.
+.sp
+
+After splitting successfully, a single commit id is printed to stdout\&. This corresponds to the HEAD of the newly created tree, which you can manipulate however you want\&.
+.sp
+
+Repeated splits of exactly the same history are guaranteed to be identical (i\&.e\&. to produce the same commit ids)\&. Because of this, if you add new commits and then re\-split, the new commits will be attached as commits on top of the history you generated last time, so
+\fIgit merge\fR
+and friends will work as expected\&.
+.sp
+
+Note that if you use
+\fI\-\-squash\fR
+when you merge, you should usually not just
+\fI\-\-rejoin\fR
+when you split\&.

+\-\-squash
+.RS 4
+
+
+
+This option is only valid for add, merge, and pull commands\&.
+.sp
+
+Instead of merging the entire history from the subtree project, produce only a single commit that contains all the differences you want to merge, and then merge that new commit into your project\&.
+.sp
+
+Using this option helps to reduce log clutter\&. People rarely want to see every change that happened between v1\&.0 and v1\&.1 of the library they\(cqre using, since none of the interim versions were ever included in their application\&.
+.sp
+
+Using
+\fI\-\-squash\fR
+also helps avoid problems when the same subproject is included multiple times in the same project, or is removed and then re\-added\&. In such a case, it doesn\(cqt make sense to combine the histories anyway, since it\(cqs unclear which part of the history belongs to which subtree\&.
+.sp
+
+Furthermore, with
+\fI\-\-squash\fR, you can switch back and forth between different versions of a subtree, rather than strictly forward\&.
+\fIgit subtree merge \-\-squash\fR
+always adjusts the subtree to match the exactly specified commit, even if getting to that commit would require undoing some changes that were added earlier\&.
+.sp
+
+Whether or not you use
+\fI\-\-squash\fR, changes made in your local repository remain intact and can be later split and send upstream to the subproject\&.

+
+
+
+.PP
+\-\-annotate=<annotation>
+.RS 4
+
+
+
+This option is only valid for the split command\&.
+.sp
+
+When generating synthetic history, add <annotation> as a prefix to each commit message\&. Since we\(cqre creating new commits with the same commit message, but possibly different content, from the original commits, this can help to differentiate them and avoid confusion\&.
+.sp
+
+Whenever you split, you need to use the same <annotation>, or else you don\(cqt have a guarantee that the new re\-created history will be identical to the old one\&. That will prevent merging from working correctly\&. git subtree tries to make it work anyway, particularly if you use \-\-rejoin, but it may not always be effective\&.
+
+.RE
+.PP
+\-b <branch>, \-\-branch=<branch>
+.RS 4
+
+
+
+
+This option is only valid for the split command\&.
+.sp
+
+After generating the synthetic history, create a new branch called <branch> that contains the new history\&. This is suitable for immediate pushing upstream\&. <branch> must not already exist\&.
+
+.RE
+.PP
+\-\-ignore\-joins
+.RS 4
+
+
+
+This option is only valid for the split command\&.
+.sp
+
+If you use
+\fI\-\-rejoin\fR, git subtree attempts to optimize its history reconstruction to generate only the new commits since the last
+\fI\-\-rejoin\fR\&.
+\fI\-\-ignore\-join\fR
+disables this behaviour, forcing it to regenerate the entire history\&. In a large project, this can take a long time\&.
+
+.RE
+.PP
+\-\-onto=<onto>
+.RS 4
+
+
+
+This option is only valid for the split command\&.
+.sp
+
+If your subtree was originally imported using something other than git subtree, its history may not match what git subtree is expecting\&. In that case, you can specify the commit id <onto> that corresponds to the first revision of the subproject\(cqs history that was imported into your project, and git subtree will attempt to build its history from there\&.
+.sp
+
+If you used
+\fIgit subtree add\fR, you should never need this option\&.
+
+.RE
+.PP
+\-\-rejoin
+.RS 4
+
+
+
+This option is only valid for the split command\&.
+.sp
+
+After splitting, merge the newly created synthetic history back into your main project\&. That way, future splits can search only the part of history that has been added since the most recent \-\-rejoin\&.
+.sp
+
+If your split commits end up merged into the upstream subproject, and then you want to get the latest upstream version, this will allow git\(cqs merge algorithm to more intelligently avoid conflicts (since it knows these synthetic commits are already part of the upstream repository)\&.
+.sp
+
+Unfortunately, using this option results in
+\fIgit log\fR
+showing an extra copy of every new commit that was created (the original, and the synthetic one)\&.
+.sp
+
+If you do all your merges with
+\fI\-\-squash\fR, don\(cqt use
+\fI\-\-rejoin\fR
+when you split, because you don\(cqt want the subproject\(cqs history to be part of your project anyway\&.
+
+.RE
+
+.SH "EXAMPLE 1\&. ADD COMMAND"
+
+.sp
+Let\(cqs assume that you have a local repository that you would like to add an external vendor library to\&. In this case we will add the git\-subtree repository as a subdirectory of your already existing git\-extensions repository in ~/git\-extensions/:

+.if n \{\

+.sp
+\fImaster\fR needs to be a valid remote ref and can be a different branch name
+.sp
+You can omit the \-\-squash flag, but doing so will increase the number of commits that are included in your local repository\&.
+.sp
+We now have a ~/git\-extensions/git\-subtree directory containing code from the master branch of git://github\&.com/apenwarr/git\-subtree\&.git in our git\-extensions repository\&.
+
+.SH "EXAMPLE 2\&. EXTRACT A SUBTREE USING COMMIT, MERGE AND PULL"

+.sp
+gitweb (commit 1130ef3) was merged into git as of commit 0a8f4f0, after which it was no longer maintained separately\&. But imagine it had been maintained separately, and we wanted to extract git\(cqs changes to gitweb since that time, to share with the upstream\&. You could do this:
+
+.sp
+.if n \{\
+.RS 4
+.\}
+.nf
+$ git subtree split \-\-prefix=gitweb \-\-annotate=\*(Aq(split) \*(Aq \e
+        0a8f4f0^\&.\&. \-\-onto=1130ef3 \-\-rejoin \e

+$ gitk gitweb\-latest
+$ git push git@github\&.com:whatever/gitweb\&.git gitweb\-latest:master
+.fi
+.if n \{\
+.RE
+.\}
+.sp
+(We use \fI0a8f4f0^\&.\&.\fR because that means "all the changes from 0a8f4f0 to the current version, including 0a8f4f0 itself\&.")
+.sp
+If gitweb had originally been merged using \fIgit subtree add\fR (or a previous split had already been done with \-\-rejoin specified) then you can do all your splits without having to remember any weird commit ids:
+
+.sp
+.if n \{\
+.RS 4
+.\}
+.nf
+$ git subtree split \-\-prefix=gitweb \-\-annotate=\*(Aq(split) \*(Aq \-\-rejoin \e
+        \-\-branch gitweb\-latest2
+.fi
+.if n \{\
+.RE
+.\}
+.sp
+And you can merge changes back in from the upstream project just as easily:
+
+.sp
+.if n \{\
+.RS 4
+.\}
+.nf
+$ git subtree pull \-\-prefix=gitweb \e
+        git@github\&.com:whatever/gitweb\&.git master
+.fi
+.if n \{\
+.RE
+.\}
+.sp
+Or, using \fI\-\-squash\fR, you can actually rewind to an earlier version of gitweb:
+
+.sp
+.if n \{\
+.RS 4
+.\}
+.nf
+$ git subtree merge \-\-prefix=gitweb \-\-squash gitweb\-latest~10
+.fi
+.if n \{\
+.RE

+.sp
+Then make some changes:
+
+.sp
+.if n \{\

+.nf
+$ date >gitweb/myfile
+$ git add gitweb/myfile
+$ git commit \-m \*(Aqcreated myfile\*(Aq
+.fi
+.if n \{\
+.RE

+.sp
+And fast forward again:
+
+.sp
+.if n \{\
+.RS 4
+.\}
+.nf
+$ git subtree merge \-\-prefix=gitweb \-\-squash gitweb\-latest
+.fi
+.if n \{\

+.sp
+And notice that your change is still intact:
+
+.sp
+.if n \{\
+.RS 4
+.\}
+.nf
+$ ls \-l gitweb/myfile
+.fi
+.if n \{\
+.RE
+.\}
+.sp
+And you can split it out and look at your changes versus the standard gitweb:
+
+.sp
+.if n \{\

+.nf
+git log gitweb\-latest\&.\&.$(git subtree split \-\-prefix=gitweb)

description         low-level cryptographic library

long_description    Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit \
                    easily in more or less any context: In crypto toolkits \
                    for object-oriented languages (C++, Python, Pike, ...), \
                    in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel \
                    space. It tries to solve a problem of providing a common \
                    set of cryptographic algorithms for higher-level \
                    applications by implementing a context-independent set of \
                    cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle doesn't \
                    do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the \
                    cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in \
                    any environment and in any way it needs.

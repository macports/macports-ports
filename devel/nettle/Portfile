description      low-level cryptographic library
long_description \
    Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more \
    or less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages \
    (C++, Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in \
    kernel space. It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of \
    cryptographic algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a \
    context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, \
    Nettle doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the \
    cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment \
    and in any way it needs.

description         First class accessor labels
long_description    \
    This package provides first class labels that can act as bidirectional \
    record fields. The labels can be derived automatically using Template \
    Haskell which means you don't have to write any boilerplate yourself. The \
    labels are implemented as lenses and are fully composable. Labels can be \
    used to get, set and modify parts of a datatype in a consistent way.

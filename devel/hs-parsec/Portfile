description         Monadic parser combinators for Haskell
long_description    Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength \
                    parser library. It is simple, safe, well documented, has \
                    extensive libraries and good error messages, and is also \
                    fast. It is defined as a monad transformer that can be \
                    stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric \
                    in the input stream type.

description         Monadic parser combinators for Haskell
long_description    Parsec is designed from scratch as an \
                    industrial-strength parser library. It is simple, \
                    safe, well documented, has extensive libraries and \
                    good error messages, and is also fast. It is \
                    defined as a monad transformer that can be stacked \
                    on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric in \
                    the input stream type.

description	Perl Compatible Regular Expressions Library
long_description	The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression \
			pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5, with just \
			a few differences. The current implementation corresponds to Perl 5.005, \
			with some additional features from the Perl development release.

description         An open-source C++ library developed and used at Facebook.
long_description    Folly (acronymed loosely after Facebook Open Source Library) is a library of \
                    C++14 components designed with practicality and efficiency in mind. Folly contains \
                    a variety of core library components used extensively at Facebook. In particular, \
                    it's often a dependency of Facebook's other open source C++ efforts and place where \
                    those projects can share code. \
                    It complements (as opposed to competing against) offerings such as Boost and of course \
                    std. In fact, we embark on defining our own component only when something we need is \
                    either not available, or does not meet the needed performance profile. We endeavor to \
                    remove things from folly if or when std or Boost obsoletes them.\
                    Performance concerns permeate much of Folly, sometimes leading to designs that are \
                    more idiosyncratic than they would otherwise be (see e.g. PackedSyncPtr.h, SmallLocks.h). \
                    Good performance at large scale is a unifying theme in all of Folly.

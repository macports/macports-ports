long_description \
    Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms \
    which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple \
    threads of execution ("multithreading") inside server applications. All \
    threads run in the same address space of the server application, but \
    each thread has it's own individual program-counter, run-time stack, \
    signal mask and errno variable.

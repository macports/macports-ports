+    * See https://trac.macports.org/ticket/45309 for an example from when
+    * a library used by a module added a new dependency which had an
+    * initializer which added a child atfork handler.  The result is that
+    * after closing the module, the system had a dangling pointer for the
+    * atfork handler which would at best crash on the child side of fork()
+    * and at worst lead to arbitrary code execution of whatever happened to be
+    * at that location in memory at a later time in the process.

description	A declarative debugger for Haskell 98 programs.
long_description	\
		Buddha is a debugger for Haskell 98 programs.		\
		To be more precise, it is a declarative debugger.	\
		It presents the evaluation of a Haskell program as	\
		a series of equivalences, rather than the more		\
		traditional stepwise presentation of debuggers for	\
		imperative languages.

#bugs		Buddha requires that the associated ghc be built	\
#		with profiling libraries. The is true for the ghc	\
#		installed by darwinports, but might not be if you	\
#		installed ghc by a different route.			\
#									\
#		Not all of the system libraries have buddha-ized	\
#		versions, and buddha will fail to produce debugging	\
#		versions of programs that use these libraries.

#user_notes	The buddha parser is not as smart as full haskell	\
#		and sometimes requires a type signature to help it	\
#		along. Try this if the original source file compiles	\
#		but under buddha you get 'ambiguous type' errors.

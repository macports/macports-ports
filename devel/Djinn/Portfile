long_description	\
		Djinn is a small program that takes a (Haskell) type and \
		returns a function of that type, if one exists.  In short, \
		a Haskell type can be seen as a proposition in logic (i.e., \
		the Curry-Howard isomorphism).  Djinn proves or disproves \
		the type proposition.  If it manages the proof, it extracts \
		a program from that. \
		This is mainly interesting as part of the lambdabot.

long_description \
	LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C. \
	It offers pretty fast compression and very fast decompression. \
	Decompression requires no memory. \
	In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite \
	competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at \
	this very high speed. \
	LZO is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

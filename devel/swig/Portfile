long_description	\
SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages.  SWIG is primarily used with common scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk, Ruby, Guile and MzScheme, however the list of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as Java and OCAML. SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software.  SWIG may be freely used, distributed, and modified for commercial and noncommercial use.

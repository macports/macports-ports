description         A command-line interface for user input, written in Haskell.
long_description    \
    Haskeline provides a user interface for line input in command-line \
    programs. This library is similar in purpose to readline, but since it is \
    written in Haskell it is (hopefully) more easily used in other Haskell \
    programs.

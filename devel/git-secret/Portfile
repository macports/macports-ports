description             Bash tool to store private data inside a git repo.
long_description        A bash tool to store your private data inside a git \
                        repo. How’s that? Basically, it just encrypts, using \
                        gpg, the tracked files with the public keys of all \
                        the users that you trust. So everyone of them can \
                        decrypt these files using only their personal secret \
                        key. Why deal with all this private-public keys \
                        stuff?  Well, to make it easier for everyone to \
                        manage access rights.  There are no passwords that \
                        change. When someone is out - just delete their \
                        public key, reencrypt the files, and they won’t be \
                        able to decrypt secrets anymore.

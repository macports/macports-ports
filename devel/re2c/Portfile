description		A tool for generating C-based recognizers from regular \
			expressions.
long_description	re2c is a tool for generating C-based recognizers from \
			regular expressions. re2c-based scanners are efficient: an \
			re2c-based scanner is said to be typically almost twice as fast as \
			a flex-based scanner with little or no increase in size.

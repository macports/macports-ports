long_description \
    The Internet Communications Engine (Ice) is a modern alternative to \
    object middleware such as CORBA or COM/DCOM/COM+, with support for \
    C++, C#, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby and Visual Basic. \
    Ice consists of the following packages. \
    Slice: The Specification Language for Ice.  Slice establishes a \
    contract between clients and servers, and is also used to describe \
    persistent data. \
    Slice Compilers: Slice specifications are compiled into various \
    programming languages. Ice supports C++, Java, C#, Visual Basic, PHP, \
    Python and Ruby.  Ice clients and servers work together, regardless \
    of the programming language. \
    Ice: The Ice core library manages all the communication tasks using a \
    highly efficient protocol (including protocol compression and support \
    for both TCP and UDP), provides a flexible thread pool for \
    multi-threaded servers. \
    This Port provides the C++ runtime libraries, the core Slice files \
    and slice2cpp.  It also includes the slice compilers for all the \
    other languages: slice2cs, slice2java, slice2py, slice2rb and slice2vb.

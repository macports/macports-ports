description     Encode data in an efficient yet extensible format.

long_description \
                Google Protocol Buffers are a flexible, efficient, \
                automated mechanism for serializing structured data -- \
                think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.  You \
                define how you want your data to be structured once, \
                then you can use special generated source code to \
                easily write and read your structured data to and from \
                a variety of data streams and using a variety of \
                languages.  You can even update your data structure \
                without breaking deployed programs that are compiled \
                against the "old" format.  You specify how you want \
                the information you're serializing to be structured by \
                defining protocol buffer message types in .proto \
                files.  Each protocol buffer message is a small \
                logical record of information, containing a series of \
                name-value pairs.

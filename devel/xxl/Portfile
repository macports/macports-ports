description		C/C++ library for exception handling and asset management
long_description	XXL is a library for C and C++ that provides exception \
			handling and asset management. Asset management is \
			integrated with the exception handling mechanism such \
			that assets may be automatically cleaned up if an \
			exception is thrown, which allows for much simplified \
			program structure with respect to error handling.

description     Cvsdelta summarizes differences between local and in-cvs files
long_description \
		cvsdelta summarizes the difference between a CVS project \
        	and its local version. It detects files that have been added \
        	and removed, and of existing files it counts the number of \
        	lines that have been added, deleted, and changed. \
       		It filters project changes by using .cvsignore \
		files, both system-wide and locally.

description         Various small helper functions for Lists, Maybes, Tuples, Functions
long_description    \
    Various small helper functions for Lists, Maybes, Tuples, Functions. Some \
    of these functions are improved implementations of standard functions. They \
    have the same name as their standard counterparts. Others are equivalent to \
    functions from the base package, but if you import them from this utility \
    package then you can write code that runs on older GHC versions or other \
    compilers like Hugs and JHC.

description     Various helper functions for Lists, Maybes, Tuples, Functions

long_description \
    Various small helper functions for Lists, Maybes, Tuples, Functions. Some \
    of these functions are improved implementations of standard functions. \
    They have the same name as their standard counterparts. The package only \
    contains functions that do not require packages other than the base \
    package. Thus you do not risk a dependency avalanche by importing it. \
    However, further splitting the base package might invalidate this statement.

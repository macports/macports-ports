description         Plumbum (Latin for lead, which was used to create pipes \
                    back in the day) is a small yet feature-rich library for \
                    shell script-like programs in Python.
long_description    ${description} The motto of the library is \"Never write \
                    shell scripts again\", and thus it attempts to mimic the \
                    shell syntax (\"shell combinators\") where it makes sense, \
                    while keeping it all pythonic and cross-platform.

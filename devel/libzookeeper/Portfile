description             C bindings for ZooKeeper, the high-performance coordination service
long_description        ZooKeeper is a distributed, open-source coordination service for \
distributed applications. It exposes a simple set of primitives that distributed applications \
can build upon to implement higher level services for synchronization, configuration \
maintenance, and groups and naming. It is designed to be easy to program to, and uses a data \
model styled after the familiar directory tree structure of file systems. This port contains \
the C bindings for interacting with it.

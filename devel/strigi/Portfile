# Best practice for CMake dictates that builds should be out of source.
# However, it appears that strigi uses java to create source files and
# they don't get put in the right place if you're doing an out of source
# build, so for now this is an in-source build. That does, however, simplify
# things because the build and destroot phases can be left at the default
# values.

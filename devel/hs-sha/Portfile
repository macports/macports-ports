description         Implementations of the SHA suite of message digest functions
long_description \
    This library implements the SHA suite of message digest functions, \
    according to NIST FIPS 180-2 (with the SHA-224 addendum), as well as the SHA-based \
    HMAC routines. The functions have been tested against most of the NIST and RFC test \
    vectors for the various functions. While some attention has been paid to performance, \
    these do not presently reach the speed of well-tuned libraries, like OpenSSL.

description         A tool for quick creation of patches against a project source tree
long_description    Patcher is a tool for quick creation of patches against \
                    a project source tree. Patcher functionality resembles \
                    a lightweight version control system. It has no \
                    repository, and only controls differences between a pristine \
                    version and a working copy.

description		General (or GNU) template generation tools
long_description	\
	The (general | GNU) template generation tools are a set of scripts \
	for creating a whole set of sources, which may already be compiled \
	and installed by using the GNU development tools. Think of gtgt as \
	a program which is able to create an already compilable, very \
	sophisticated "hello world" program, written in C or C++ and \
	constituted by a main program, two internal modules (classes), one \
	static and one shared library. Using gitty-gitty you will get a \
	template of sources for the main cases you might meet, and which \
	you can also use as examples for automake, autoconf and so on.

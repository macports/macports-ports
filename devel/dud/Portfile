description         Dud is a lightweight tool for versioning data alongside \
                    source code and building data pipelines.
long_description    {*}${description} \
    In practice, Dud extends many of the benefits of source control to large \
    binary data.\nWith Dud, you can commit, checkout, fetch, and push large \
    files and directories with a simple command line interface. Dud stores \
    recipes (a.k.a. stages) for retrieving your data in small YAML files. \
    These stages can be stored in source control to link your data to your \
    code. On top of that, stages can run the commands to generate the data, \
    sort of like Make. Stages can be chained together to create data \
    pipelines. See the Getting Started guide for a hands-on overview.

long_description	\
	CUT is a C-language tool for developing and automatically maintaining \
	unit tests. CUT works well for C, C++, and objective-C. Although it was \
	expressly designed to help support test-driven development and agile \
	development processes such as extreme programming, CUT is still useful \
	for writing automated test fixtures for more traditional software \
	development processes as well.

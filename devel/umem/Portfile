name                    umem
description             userland slab allocator
long_description        Libumem is a library used to detect memory management bugs in applications. \
It is based on the Slab allocator concept. Functions in this library provide fast, scalable \
object-caching memory allocation with multithreaded application support. In addition to the \
standard malloc(3C) family of functions and the more flexible umem_alloc(3MALLOC) family, \
libumem provides powerful object-caching services as described in umem_cache_create(3MALLOC). \
This slab allocator is designed for systems with many threads and many CPUs. Memory allocation \
with naive allocators can be a serious bottleneck. There are other highly scalable allocators \
out there, but libumem is about the same or better in terms of performance, and has compelling \
debugging features.

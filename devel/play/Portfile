description         Rapid webapplication development framework

long_description    The Play framework is a clean alternative to bloated Enterprise Java stacks. \
                    It focuses on developer productivity and targets RESTful architectures. \
                    Play is a perfect companion to agile software development. \
                    Play is a pure Java framework and allows you to keep your preferred \
                    development tools and libraries. If you already use Java as a  \
                    development platform you don't need to switch to another language, \
                    another IDE and other libraries. \
                    The Play framework's goal is to ease web applications \
                    development while sticking with Java. (From the documentation)

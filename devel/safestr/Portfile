description		Safe C String Library
long_description	The goal of the SafeStr library is to provide a rich \
			string-handling library for C that has safe semantics \
			yet interoperates with legacy library code in a \
			straightforward manner. Additionally, porting code \
			that uses standard C string handling should be \
			straightforward. The library should work on all modern \
			Unix-like platforms, as well as any 32-bit Microsoft \
			Windows OS.

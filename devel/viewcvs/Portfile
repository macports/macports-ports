long_description	\
	ViewCVS was inspired by cvsweb (Zeller's version).  ViewCVS can \
	browse directories, change logs, and specific revisions of files. It \
	can display diffs between versions and show selections of files \
	based on tags or branches. In addition, ViewCVS has "annotation" or \
	"blame" support, and the beginnings of Bonsai-like query facilities.

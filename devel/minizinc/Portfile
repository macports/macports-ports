description         MiniZinc is a free and open-source constraint modeling \
                    language.

long_description    {*}${description} You can use MiniZinc to model \
                    constraint satisfaction and optimization problems in a \
                    high-level, solver-independent way, taking advantage of a \
                    large library of pre-defined constraints. Your model is \
                    then compiled into FlatZinc, a solver input language that \
                    is understood by a wide range of solvers. MiniZinc is \
                    developed at Monash University in collaboration with \
                    Data61 Decision Sciences and the University of Melbourne.

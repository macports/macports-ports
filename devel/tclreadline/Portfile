description                 An interactive readline for tcl shells.

long_description            The tclreadline package makes the GNU Readline \
                            library available for interactive tcl shells. \
                            This includes history expansion and file/command \
                            completion. Command completion for all tcl/tk \
                            commands is provided and commmand completers for \
                            user defined commands can be easily added. \
                            tclreadline can also be used for tcl scripts \
                            which want to use a shell like input interface. \
                            In this case the ::tclreadline::readline read \
                            command has to be called explicitly.

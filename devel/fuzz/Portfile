description         Software security checking tool
long_description    The fuzz generator is designed to attack certain kinds \
                    of software and expose one particular kind of bug \
                    common in software. This is the situation where \
                    a programmer implicity makes some assumtions about \
                    the data stream that the program will be parsing.  \
                    If the data stream is substantially different then \
                    the program might not be able to deal with it.

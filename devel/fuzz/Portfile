long_description 	The fuzz generator is designed to attack certain kinds \
			of software and expose one particular kind of bug \
			common in software. This is the situation where the \
			programmer implicity makes some assumtions about \
			the data stream that the program will be parsing.  \
			If the data stream is substantially different then \
			the program might not be able to deal with it.

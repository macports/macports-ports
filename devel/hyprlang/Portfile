                    for applications.

# The port requires C++23, and builds either on macOS 13+ with clangs,
# or on old systems which can use libstdc++ with modern gcc.
# libc++ of macOS 12 cannot handle it, and unfortunately
# Macports does not support building against libstdc++ anymore
# on modern systems. In particular, on macOS 12
# clang-17 fails at linking with this kind of error:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58923623/stdto-chars-compile-but-not-linking-on-macos-clang
# gcc13 is broken with libc++ at the moment:
# https://trac.macports.org/ticket/68592
# gcc12 fails due to missing <expected>. gcc10-bootstrap also cannot build it,
# complaining about missing <format>.
# Looks like we need to wait until Macports can supply a modern C++ runtime
# for systems lacking it. Currently macports-libcxx uses clang-11 headers,
# which is too old. A manual solution would be to switch to libstdc++
# and build everything against it, with gcc13+.

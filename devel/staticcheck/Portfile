description         Staticcheck - The advanced Go linter

long_description    \
    Staticcheck is a state of the art linter for the Go programming language. \
    Using static analysis, it finds bugs and performance issues, offers \
    simplifications, and enforces style rules.  Each of the 100+ checks has \
    been designed to be fast, precise and useful. When Staticcheck flags \
    code, you can be sure that it isn't wasting your time with unactionable \
    warnings. While checks have been designed to be useful out of the box, \
    they still provide configuration where necessary, to fine-tune to your \
    needs, without overwhelming you with hundreds of options.  Included with \
    Staticcheck is a collection of tools for working with Go code, including \
    linters and static analysis.

description         Staticcheck - The advanced Go linter

long_description    Staticcheck is a state of the art linter for the Go \
                    programming language. Using static analysis, it finds \
                    bugs and performance issues, offers simplifications, and \
                    enforces style rules.  Each of the 100+ checks has been \
                    designed to be fast, precise and useful. When Staticcheck \
                    flags code, you can be sure that it isn't wasting your \
                    time with unactionable warnings. While checks have been \
                    designed to be useful out of the box, they still provide \
                    configuration where necessary, to fine-tune to your \
                    needs, without overwhelming you with hundreds of options. \
                    Included with Staticcheck is a collection of tools for \
                    working with Go code, including linters and static \
                    analysis.

description         Installer wrapper for Haskell applications
long_description    \
    This module allows you to incorporate arbitrary files into a haskell module \
    during compilation. The files are then available to you through functions \
    which allows you to write installer-type applications which write out the \
    files when run. Thus this can be considered in the same model as Java .jar \
    files or executable zip or other file archives.

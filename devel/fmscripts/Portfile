description         Wrapper Scripts for FileMerge
long_description \
    Apple's Developer Tools for Mac OS X include FileMerge, a graphical \
    tool to compare and merge files.  FileMerge can be much handier to use, unfortunately, \
    it doesn't integrate with Subversion straightforwardly.  It can be opened from the \
    command line with the opendiff command, but its interface differs from that of diff \
    and diff3. It returns immediately (i.e. it forks and does not block) and it expects \
    different arguments.

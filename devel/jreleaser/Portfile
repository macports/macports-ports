description      Release projects quickly and easily with JReleaser
long_description JReleaser is a release automation tool. Its goal is to simplify creating releases \
                 and publishing artifacts to multiple package managers while providing customizable options. \
                  \
                 JReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle) such as JAR files, binary \
                 distributions (.zip, .tar), JLink images, or any other file that youâ€™d like to publish as a Git \
                 release on popular Git services such as Github or Gitlab. Distribution files can additionally be \
                 published to be consumed by popular package managers as Homebrew, Snapcraft, or get ready to be \
                 launched via JBang. Releases may be announced in a variety of channels such as Twitter, Zulip, or SDKMAN!

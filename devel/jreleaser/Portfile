description      Release projects quickly and easily with JReleaser
long_description JReleaser is a release automation tool. Its goal is to simplify creating releases and \
                 publishing artifacts to multiple package managers while providing customizable options. \
                  \
                 JReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle) such as JAR files, \
                 binary distributions (.zip, .tar), JLink images, or any other file that youâ€™d like to \
                 publish as a Git release on popular Git services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea. \
                 Distribution files may additionally be published to be consumed by popular package managers \
                 such as Homebrew, Chocolatey, Snapcraft, or get ready to be launched via JBang. Releases \
                 may be announced in a variety of channels such as Twitter, Zulip, SDKMAN!, and more.

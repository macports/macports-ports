long_description \
    QTermWidget is an open-source project originally based on the KDE4 Konsole \
    application, but it took its own direction later on. The main goal of this \
    project is to provide a unicode-enabled, embeddable Qt widget for using as \
    a built-in console (or terminal emulation widget).

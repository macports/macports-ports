description         An incremental parsing system for programming tools

long_description    Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental \
                    parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for \
                    a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as \
                    the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be: \
                    General enough to parse any programming language, Fast \
                    enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor, \
                    Robust enough to provide useful results even in the \
                    presence of syntax errors, Dependency-free so that the \
                    runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be \
                    embedded in any application

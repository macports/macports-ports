# Configuration
lab needs your GitLab information in order to interact with to your GitLab instance.
There are several ways to provide this information to lab:

1. Environment variables: LAB_CORE_HOST, LAB_CORE_USER, LAB_CORE_TOKEN
2. Environment variables: CI_PROJECT_URL, CI_REGISTRY_USER, CI_JOB_TOKEN
  * Note: these are meant for when lab is running within a GitLab CI pipeline
3. HCL config file: ./lab.hcl
4. HCL config file: ~/.config/lab.hcl

These are checked in order. If no suitable config values are found, lab will prompt
for your GitLab information and save it into ~/.config/lab.hcl. For example:

```
$ lab
Enter default GitLab host (default: https://gitlab.com):
Enter default GitLab user: zaq
Enter default GitLab token:
```

Like hub, lab feels best when aliased as git. In your .bashrc or .bash_profile, put:
alias git=lab

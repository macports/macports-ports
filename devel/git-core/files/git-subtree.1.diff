+.SH "DESCRIPTION"
+.sp
+Subtrees allow subprojects to be included within a subdirectory of the main project, optionally including the subproject\(cqs entire history\&.
+.sp
+For example, you could include the source code for a library as a subdirectory of your application\&.
+.sp
+Subtrees are not to be confused with submodules, which are meant for the same task\&. Unlike submodules, subtrees do not need any special constructions (like \&.gitmodule files or gitlinks) be present in your repository, and do not force end\-users of your repository to do anything special or to understand how subtrees work\&. A subtree is just a subdirectory that can be committed to, branched, and merged along with your project in any way you want\&.
+.sp
+They are also not to be confused with using the subtree merge strategy\&. The main difference is that, besides merging the other project as a subdirectory, you can also extract the entire history of a subdirectory from your project and make it into a standalone project\&. Unlike the subtree merge strategy you can alternate back and forth between these two operations\&. If the standalone library gets updated, you can automatically merge the changes into your project; if you update the library inside your project, you can "split" the changes back out again and merge them back into the library project\&.
+.sp
+For example, if a library you made for one application ends up being useful elsewhere, you can extract its entire history and publish that as its own git repository, without accidentally intermingling the history of your application project\&.

+.sp
+In order to keep your commit messages clean, we recommend that people split their commits between the subtrees and the main project as much as possible\&. That is, if you make a change that affects both the library and the main application, commit it in two pieces\&. That way, when you split the library commits out later, their descriptions will still make sense\&. But if this isn\(cqt important to you, it\(cqs not \fBnecessary\fR\&. git subtree will simply leave out the non\-library\-related parts of the commit when it splits it out into the subproject later\&.

+.RE
+.SH "COMMANDS"
+.PP
+add
+.RS 4
+Create the <prefix> subtree by importing its contents from the given <refspec> or <repository> and remote <refspec>\&. A new commit is created automatically, joining the imported project\(cqs history with your own\&. With
+\fI\-\-squash\fR, imports only a single commit from the subproject, rather than its entire history\&.
+.RE
+.PP
+merge
+.RS 4
+Merge recent changes up to <commit> into the <prefix> subtree\&. As with normal
+\fIgit merge\fR, this doesn\(cqt remove your own local changes; it just merges those changes into the latest <commit>\&. With
+\fI\-\-squash\fR, creates only one commit that contains all the changes, rather than merging in the entire history\&.
+.sp
+.if n \{\
+.RS 4
+.\}
+.nf
+If you use \*(Aq\-\-squash\*(Aq, the merge direction doesn\*(Aqt
+always have to be forward; you can use this command to
+go back in time from v2\&.5 to v2\&.4, for example\&.  If your
+merge introduces a conflict, you can resolve it in the
+usual ways\&.
+.fi
+.if n \{\
+.RE
+.\}
+.RE
+.PP
+pull
+.RS 4
+Exactly like
+\fImerge\fR, but parallels
+\fIgit pull\fR
+in that it fetches the given commit from the specified remote repository\&.
+.RE
+.PP
+push
+.RS 4
+Does a
+\fIsplit\fR
+(see above) using the <prefix> supplied and then does a
+\fIgit push\fR
+to push the result to the repository and refspec\&. This can be used to push your subtree to different branches of the remote repository\&.
+.RE
+.PP
+split
+.RS 4
+Extract a new, synthetic project history from the history of the <prefix> subtree\&. The new history includes only the commits (including merges) that affected <prefix>, and each of those commits now has the contents of <prefix> at the root of the project instead of in a subdirectory\&. Thus, the newly created history is suitable for export as a separate git repository\&.
+.sp
+.if n \{\
+.RS 4
+.\}
+.nf
+After splitting successfully, a single commit id is
+printed to stdout\&.  This corresponds to the HEAD of the
+newly created tree, which you can manipulate however you
+want\&.
+.fi
+.if n \{\
+.RE
+.\}
+.sp
+.if n \{\
+.RS 4
+.\}
+.nf
+Repeated splits of exactly the same history are
+guaranteed to be identical (ie\&. to produce the same
+commit ids)\&.  Because of this, if you add new commits
+and then re\-split, the new commits will be attached as
+commits on top of the history you generated last time,
+so \*(Aqgit merge\*(Aq and friends will work as expected\&.
+.fi

+Using this option helps to reduce log clutter\&. People
+rarely want to see every change that happened between
+v1\&.0 and v1\&.1 of the library they\*(Aqre using, since none of the
+interim versions were ever included in their application\&.

+Using \*(Aq\-\-squash\*(Aq also helps avoid problems when the same
+subproject is included multiple times in the same
+project, or is removed and then re\-added\&.  In such a
+case, it doesn\*(Aqt make sense to combine the histories
+anyway, since it\*(Aqs unclear which part of the history
+belongs to which subtree\&.
+.fi

+.nf
+Furthermore, with \*(Aq\-\-squash\*(Aq, you can switch back and
+forth between different versions of a subtree, rather
+than strictly forward\&.  \*(Aqgit subtree merge \-\-squash\*(Aq
+always adjusts the subtree to match the exactly

+require undoing some changes that were added earlier\&.

+When generating synthetic history, add <annotation> as a

+Whenever you split, you need to use the same
+<annotation>, or else you don\*(Aqt have a guarantee that

+gitweb (commit 1130ef3) was merged into git as of commit 0a8f4f0, after which it was no longer maintained separately\&. But imagine it had been maintained separately, and we wanted to extract git\(cqs changes to gitweb since that time, to share with the upstream\&. You could do this:

+.sp
+If gitweb had originally been merged using \fIgit subtree add\fR (or a previous split had already been done with \-\-rejoin specified) then you can do all your splits without having to remember any weird commit ids:

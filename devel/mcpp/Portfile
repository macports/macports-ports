description         Alternative C/C++ preprocessor
long_description    \
    C/C++ preprocessor defines and expands macros and processes '#if',     \
    '#include' and some other directives.                                  \
    MCPP is an alternative C/C++ preprocessor with the highest conformance.\
    It supports multiple standards: K&R, ISO C90, ISO C99, and ISO C++98.  \
    MCPP is especially useful for debugging a source program which uses    \
    complicated macros and also useful for checking portability of a       \
    source.                                                                \
    Though mcpp could be built as a replacement of GCC's resident          \
    preprocessor, this port installs a program which behaves independent   \
    from GCC.

description         GDB-like debugger for zsh scripts.
long_description    ${description} Zshdb can run your script, stop it on \
                    specified conditions, help you examine what has happened \
                    when it has stopped, and allow you to modify parts of your \
                    script so that you can experiment with your code and fix \
                    problems once they are identified.

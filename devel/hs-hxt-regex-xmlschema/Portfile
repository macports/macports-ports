description         A regular expression library for W3C XML Schema regular expressions
long_description    \
    This library supports full W3C XML Schema regular expressions inclusive all \
    Unicode character sets and blocks. The complete grammar can be found under \
    http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#regexs. It is implemented by the \
    technique of derivations of regular expressions. The W3C syntax is extended \
    to support not only union of regular sets, but also intersection, set \
    difference, exor. Matching of subexpressions is also supported. The library \
    can be used for constricting lightweight scanners and tokenizers. It is \
    a standalone library, no external regex libraries are used. This package is \
    a substitute for the old regex-xmlschema package.

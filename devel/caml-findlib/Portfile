description         Objective Caml library management system
long_description    The findlib library provides a scheme to manage reusable \
                    software components (packages), and includes tools that support \
                    this scheme. Packages are collections of OCaml modules for which \
                    metainformation can be stored. The packages are kept in the filesystem \
                    hierarchy, but with strict directory structure. The library contains \
                    functions to look the directory up that stores a package, to query \
                    metainformation about a package, and to retrieve dependency information \
                    about multiple packages. There is also a tool that allows the user to \
                    enter queries on the command-line. In order to simplify compilation and \
                    linkage, there are new frontends of the various OCaml compilers that \
                    can directly deal with packages.

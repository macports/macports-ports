description             Smaller, easier, more powerful, and more reliable than make.
long_description        \
    redo is literally the most amazingly groundbreaking build system since \
    the original invention of 'make'. Claims: \
        it can do everything make can do\; \
        with no baked-in assumptions about what you're building\; \
        with much less code\; \
        with much greater parallelism\; \
        with finer-grained dependencies\; \
        with much less syntax (actually nothing but /bin/sh)\; \
        while supporting recursion and full dependency information simultaneously \
            (no Recursive Make Considered Harmful crap)\; \
        yet build scripts are highly modular and readable\; \
        and you can checksum your targets instead of using timestamps\; \
        and your build scripts run linearly instead of an orderless \"ruleset\"\; \
        with no implicit rules required\; \
        and implementing C header autodependencies is completely sane\; \
        and dependency checks involve no forking or parsing so it's crazy fast\; \
        and you can incrementally convert parts of your project\; \
        because it can play well with other build systems\; \
        including jobserver compatibility with make -j\; \
        oh, and you can write a plug-compatible toy implementation in 100 lines of shell.

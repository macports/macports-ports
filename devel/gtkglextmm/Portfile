# Fix build issue where build fails due to GDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED being enabled.
# The order in which files are included matters here. gtkmm does some funky
# stuff to undefine GDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED, if defined, before including gdk.h
# as it needs some deprecated functionality. Including gtkglwidget.h before
# widget.h causes gdk.h to be included without GDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED being
# undefined, and gtkmm never gets the chance to work its undefine magic.

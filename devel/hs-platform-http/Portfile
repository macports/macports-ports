description             \
    The HTTP package supports client-side web programming in Haskell. It lets \
    you set up HTTP connections, transmitting requests and processing the \
    responses coming back, all from within the comforts of Haskell. It's \
    dependent on the network package to operate, but other than that, the \
    implementation is all written in Haskell.
long_description        ${description} \
    A basic API for issuing single HTTP requests + receiving responses is \
    provided. On top of that, a session-level abstraction is also on offer (the \
    BrowserAction monad): it taking care of handling the management of \
    persistent connections, proxies, state (cookies) and authentication \
    credentials required to handle multi-step interactions with a web server. \
    \
    The representation of the bytes flowing across is extensible via the use of \
    a type class, letting you pick the representation of requests and responses \
    that best fits your use. Some pre-packaged, common instances are provided \
    for you (ByteString, String.)

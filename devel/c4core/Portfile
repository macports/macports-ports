description         c4core is a library of low-level C++ utilities

long_description    \
    {*}${description}, written with low-latency projects in mind. Some of the \
    utilities provided by c4core have already equivalent functionality in the \
    C++ standard, but they are provided as the existing C++ equivalent may be \
    insufficient \(eg, std\:\:string_view\), inefficient \(eg, \
    std\:\:string\), heavy \(eg streams\), or plainly unusable on some \
    platforms\/projects, \(eg exceptions\)\; some other utilities have \
    equivalent under consideration for C++ standardisation\; and yet some \
    other utilities have \(to my knowledge\) no equivalent under consideration.

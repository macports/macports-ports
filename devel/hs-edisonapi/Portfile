description         A library of efficent, purely-functional data structures (API)
long_description    \
    Edison is a library of purely functional data structures written by Chris \
    Okasaki. It is named after Thomas Alva Edison and for the mnemonic value \
    EDiSon (Efficent Data Structures). Edison provides several families of \
    abstractions, each with multiple implementations. The main abstractions \
    provided by Edison are: Sequences such as stacks, queues, and dequeues\; \
    Collections such as sets, bags and heaps\; and Associative Collections such \
    as finite maps and priority queues where the priority and element are \
    distinct.

    recursive-descent parser generators for C

long_description    \
    peg and leg are tools for generating recursive-descent parsers: programs \
    that perform pattern matching on text. They processes a Parsing \
    Expression Grammar (PEG) \[Ford 2004\] to produce a program that \
    recognises legal sentences of that grammar. peg processes PEGs written \
    using the original syntax described by Ford\; leg processes PEGs written \
    using slightly different syntax and conventions that are intended to make \
    it an attractive replacement for parsers built with lex and yacc. Unlike \
    lex and yacc, peg and leg support unlimited backtracking, provide ordered \
    choice as a means for disambiguation, and can combine scanning (lexical \
    analysis) and parsing (syntactic analysis) into a single activity.

description         client-side web programming in Haskell
long_description    \
    The HTTP package supports client-side web programming in Haskell. \
    It lets you set up HTTP connections, transmitting requests and processing \
    the responses coming back, all from within the comforts of Haskell. It's \
    dependent on the network package to operate, but other than that, the \
    implementation is all written in Haskell. \
    \
    A basic API for issuing single HTTP requests + receiving responses is \
    provided. On top of that, a session-level abstraction is also on offer \
    (the BrowserAction monad)\; it taking care of handling the management of \
    persistent connections, proxies, state (cookies) and authentication \
    credentials required to handle multi-step interactions with a web server. \
    \
    The representation of the bytes flowing across is extensible via the use \
    of a type class, letting you pick the representation of requests and \
    responses that best fits your use. Some pre-packaged, common instances \
    are provided for you (ByteString, String.)

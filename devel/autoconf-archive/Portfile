description		A collection of over 500 reusable Autoconf macros
long_description 	The Autoconf Macro Archive aims to provide a collection of reusable Autoconf \
			macros as free software. The archive currently features more than 500 macros \
			which perform portability tests ranging from compiler support for weird language \
			extensions to automatic generation of sophisticated Automake rules. All these \
			macros have been contributed by friendly supporters of the cause from all over \
			the Internet - this archive is merely a distribution of other people's efforts.

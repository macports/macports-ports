description         A collection of over 500 reusable Autoconf macros
long_description    The Autoconf Macro Archive aims to provide a collection of reusable Autoconf \
    macros as free software. The archive currently features more than 500 macros \
    which perform portability tests ranging from compiler support for weird language \
    extensions to automatic generation of sophisticated Automake rules. All these \
    macros have been contributed by friendly supporters of the cause from all over \
    the Internet - this archive is merely a distribution of other people's efforts.

description         The tecla library provides UNIX and LINUX programs with interactive command line editing facilities, similar to those of the unix tcsh shell.
long_description    ${description} In addition to simple command-line editing, it supports recall of previously entered command lines, TAB completion of file names, and in-line wild-card expansion of filenames.  The internal functions which perform file-name completion and wild-card expansion are also available externally for optional use by programs, along with a module for tab-completion and lookup of filenames in a list of directories.

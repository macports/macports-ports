description         Unified runtime system for heterogeneous multicore architectures
long_description    StarPU is a runtime system that offers support for heterogeneous multicore machines. \
                    While many efforts are devoted to design efficient computation kernels \
                    for those architectures (e.g. to implement BLAS kernels on GPUs), StarPU \
                    not only takes care of offloading such kernels (and implementing data coherency \
                    across the machine), but it also makes sure the kernels are executed as efficiently as possible.

# The following option allows for non-conflicting installation of binaries into ${prefix}/bin;
# However it does not work neatly, and multiple files will need to be patched in that case.
# Furthermore, given the number of components that get installed, having multiple versions of StarPU
# directly in ${prefix} quickly becomes a mess, even though headers and dylibs are versioned (but pkgconfig files are not).
# It appears to make a better sense, and far less painful to maintain, just to set a custom prefix.

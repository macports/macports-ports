long_description    GNU indent changes the appearance of a C program \
                    by inserting or deleting whitespace according to \
                    a plethora of options. Some canned styles of \
                    formatting are supported as well. GNU indent is \
                    a descendant of BSD indent. GNU indent does NOT \
                    work for C++, only C.

description         C program cross-referencing & documentation tool
long_description    A program that takes as input a series of C source \
                    files and produces a LaTeX or HTML document \
                    containing a cross reference of the
                    files/functions/variables in the program, including \
                    documentation taken from suitably formatted source \
                    code comments. The documentation is stored in the \
                    C source file in specially formatted comments, \
                    making it simple to maintain. The cross referencing \
                    includes lists of functions called, callers of each \
                    function, usage of global variables, header file \
                    inclusion, macro definitions and type definitions. \
                    Works for ANSI C, including a few gcc extensions.

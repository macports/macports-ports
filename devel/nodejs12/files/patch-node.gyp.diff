Don't use -latomic on macOS. Clang on macOS doesn't use libatomic.

https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/30093

This bug caused the build to fail when using MacPorts clang. Due to a second
bug, in which node's build system misidentifies clang from Xcode 7 and later
as "not clang", it didn't add -latomic for Xcode clang and thus the build
succeeded.

description         Like cURL, but for gRPC: Command-line tool for \
                    interacting with gRPC servers

long_description    {*}${description}. The main purpose for this tool is to \
                    invoke RPC methods on a gRPC server from the \
                    command-line. gRPC servers use a binary encoding on the \
                    wire (protocol buffers, or "protobufs" for short). So \
                    they are basically impossible to interact with using \
                    regular curl (and older versions of curl that do not \
                    support HTTP/2 are of course non-starters). This program \
                    accepts messages using JSON encoding, which is much more \
                    friendly for both humans and scripts.

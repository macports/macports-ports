description         Bloat-free Graphical User interface for C++
long_description    \
    Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. \
    It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your \
    3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic \
    and self-contained (no external dependencies).\nDear ImGui is designed to \
    enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content \
    creation tools and visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI for the \
    average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this \
    goal, and lacks certain features normally found in more high-level \
    libraries.\nDear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in games \
    engine (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, \
    embedded applications, or any applications on consoles platforms where \
    operating system features are non-standard.

description       Create patchset information from CVS.
long_description  CVSps is a program for generating 'patchset' information \
                  from a CVS repository. A patchset in this case is defined \
                  as a set of changes made to a collection of files, and all \
                  committed at the same time (using a single 'cvs commit' \
                  command). This information is valuable to seeing the big \
                  picture of the evolution of a cvs project. While cvs tracks \
                  revision information, it is often difficult to see what \
                  changes were committed 'atomically' to the repository.

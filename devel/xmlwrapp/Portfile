long_description  xmlwrapp is a modern style C++ library for working with XML data. \
                  It provides a simple and easy to use interface for the very \
                  powerful libxml2 XML parser and the libxslt XSLT engine.  It used \
		  to be hosted at pmade.org, but the author no longer wants to support \
		  his work, so it's now hosted at sourceforge.  This Portfile also \
		  installs libxsltwrapp which is part of the xmlwrapp package.

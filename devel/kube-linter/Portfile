description         \
    KubeLinter is a static analysis tool that checks Kubernetes YAML files \
    and Helm charts to ensure the applications represented in them adhere to \
    best practices.
long_description    {*}${description} \
    \nKubeLinter runs sensible default checks, designed to give you useful \
    information about your Kubernetes YAML files and Helm charts. This is to \
    help teams check early and often for security misconfigurations and \
    DevOps best practices. Some common examples of these include running \
    containers as a non-root user, enforcing least privilege, and storing \
    sensitive information only in secrets. \
    \nKubeLinter is configurable, so you can enable and disable checks, as \
    well as create your own custom checks, depending on the policies you want \
    to follow within your organization. \
    \nWhen a lint check fails, KubeLinter reports recommendations for how to \
    resolve any potential issues and returns a non-zero exit code.

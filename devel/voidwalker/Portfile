description         A GDB toolbox for low-level debugging.
long_description    (void)walker is a toolbox for GDB which provides utilities \
                    for debugging software on an instruction level. It is \
                    heavily influenced by the gdbinit by mammon_, elaine, fG! et \
                    al. but opens up for a much more advanced solution by using \
                    Python instead of GDB commands.

 notes              "Add the following line to your ~/.gdbinit to have it loaded\
automatically whenever GDB is launched:

    python from voidwalker import voidwalker

The next time you start GDB you should see (void)walker being loaded."

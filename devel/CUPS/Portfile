description         The standards-based, open source printing system developed by Apple for iOS®, iPadOS®, and macOS®. \
                    CUPS uses IPP Everywhere™ to support printing to local and network printers.
long_description    CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system developed by Apple Inc. \
                    for macOS® and other UNIX®-like operating systems.  CUPS uses the Internet \
                    Printing Protocol ("IPP") and provides System V and Berkeley command-line \
                    interfaces, a web interface, and a C API to manage printers and print jobs.  It \
                    supports printing to both local (parallel, serial, USB) and networked printers, \
                    and printers can be shared from one computer to another, even over the Internet! \
                    Internally, CUPS uses PostScript Printer Description ("PPD") files to describe \
                    printer capabilities and features and a wide variety of generic and device- \
                    specific programs to convert and print many types of files.  Sample drivers are \
                    included with CUPS to support many Dymo, EPSON, HP, Intellitech, OKIDATA, and \
                    Zebra printers.  Many more drivers are available online and (in some cases) on \
                    the driver CD-ROM that came with your printer.

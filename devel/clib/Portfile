    Package manager for the C programming language.

    {*}${description} Basically the lazy-man’s copy/paste promoting smaller C \
    utilities, also serving as a nice way to discover these sort of \
    libraries. The goal of clibs is to provide stand-alone “micro” C \
    libraries for developers to quickly install without coupling to large \
    frameworks.  You should use clib(1) to fetch these files for you and \
    check them into your repository, the end-user and contributors should not \
    require having clib(1) installed.  This allows clib(1) to fit into any \
    new or existing C workflow without friction.

description         Package manager for the C programming language.

long_description    {*}${description} Basically the lazy-man’s copy/paste \
                    promoting smaller C utilities, also serving as a nice way \
                    to discover these sort of libraries. The goal of clibs is \
                    to provide stand-alone “micro” C libraries for developers \
                    to quickly install without coupling to large frameworks. \
                    You should use clib(1) to fetch these files for you and \
                    check them into your repository, the end-user and \
                    contributors should not require having clib(1) installed. \
                    This allows clib(1) to fit into any new or existing C \
                    workflow without friction.

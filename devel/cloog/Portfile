description         The CLooG Code Generator in the Polyhedral Model's Home

long_description    CLooG is a free software and library to generate code for scanning Z-polyhedra. \
                    That is, it finds a code (e.g. in C, FORTRAN...) that reaches each \
                    integral point of one or more parameterized polyhedra. CLooG has been \
                    originally written to solve the code generation problem for optimizing \
                    compilers based on the polytope model. Nevertheless it is used now in \
                    various area e.g. to build control automata for high-level synthesis \
                    or to find the best polynomial approximation of a function. CLooG may \
                    help in any situation where scanning polyhedra matters. While the user \
                    has full control on generated code quality, CLooG is designed to avoid \
                    control overhead and to produce a very effective code.

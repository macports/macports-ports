description             Utilities for accessing and manipulating fields of records
long_description        \
    With this package you can define record field accessors which allow \
    setting, getting and modifying values easily. The package clearly \
    demonstrates the power of the functional approach: You can combine \
    accessors of a record and sub-records, to make the access look like the \
    fields of the sub-record belong to the main record.

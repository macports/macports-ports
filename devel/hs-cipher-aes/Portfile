description         Fast AES cipher implementation with advanced mode of operations
long_description    \
    Fast AES cipher implementation with advanced mode of operations. \
    \nThe modes of operations available are ECB (Electronic code book), CBC \
    (Cipher block chaining), CTR (Counter), XTS (XEX with ciphertext stealing), \
    GCM (Galois Counter Mode). \
    \nThe AES implementation uses AES-NI when available (on x86 and x86-64 \
    architecture), but fallback gracefully to a software C implementation. \
    \nThe software implementation uses S-Boxes, which might suffer for cache \
    timing issues. However do notes that most other known software \
    implementations, including very popular one (openssl, gnutls) also uses \
    similar implementation. If it matters for your case, you should make sure \
    you have AES-NI available, or you'll need to use a different \
    implementation.

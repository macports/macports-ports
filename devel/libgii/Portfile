description      General Input Interface
long_description \
	LibGII is intended to be to input what LibGGI is to \
	graphics. LibGII is based on the concept of input \
	streams, which virtualize access to the underlying \
	input drivers. Events from various input devices are \
	abstracted into easy-to-use structures. LibGII also \
	allows the application to join streams together, \
	receiving input from an arbitrary combination of \
	devices. LibGII is a separate component from LibGGI, \
	although LibGGI depends on LibGII for input purposes.

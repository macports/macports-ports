description         Examines C/C++ source code for security flaw
long_description \
    Program that examines source code and reports possible  \
    security weaknesses (``flaws'') sorted by risk level.   \
    It's very useful for quickly finding and removing at    \
    least some potential security problems before a program \
    is widely released to the public.

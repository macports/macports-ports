description         A portable scheme library

long_description    SLIB is a portable library for the programming \
                    language Scheme.  It provides a platform \
                    independent framework for using packages of \
                    Scheme procedures and syntax.  As distributed, \
                    SLIB contains useful packages for all Scheme \
                    implementations.  Its catalog can be transparently \
                    extended to accomodate packages specific to a site, \
                    implementation, user, or directory.

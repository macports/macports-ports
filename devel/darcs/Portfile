description         A distributed, interactive, smart revision control system

long_description    \
    Darcs is a free, open source revision control system. It is: \
    \n- Distributed: Every user has access to the full command set, removing \
    boundaries between server and client or committer and non-committers. \
    \n- Interactive: Darcs is easy to learn and efficient to use because it asks \
    you questions in response to simple commands, giving you choices in your \
    work flow. You can choose to record one change in a file, while ignoring \
    another. As you update from upstream, you can review each patch name, \
    even the full diff for interesting patches. \
    \n- Smart: Originally developed by physicist David Roundy, darcs is based on \
    a unique algebra of patches. \
    \nThis smartness lets you respond to changing demands in ways that would \
    otherwise not be possible. Learn more about spontaneous branches with \
    darcs.

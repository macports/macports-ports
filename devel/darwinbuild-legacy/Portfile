description     Darwinbuild is a set of tools that facilitate building the sources \
		released by Apple.

long_description \
		The Darwin Build Scripts are a collection of tools that assist compilation of \
		the many projects contained in Darwin, the open source base of Apple's \
		Mac OS X operating system.  Apple publishes the sources of these projects \
		in an archive format (.tar.gz).  An archive is published for each project \
		version on Apple's site. These tools will provide the proper build environment as well as help to \
		resolve any necessary dependencies prior to building.

description             Automatic testing of Haskell programs
long_description        \
    QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties. The \
    programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form of \
    properties which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then tests \
    that the properties hold in a large number of randomly generated cases.

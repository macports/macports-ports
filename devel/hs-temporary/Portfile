description         Haskell library for creating temporary files and directories
long_description \
    The functions for creating temporary files and directories in the base \
    library are quite limited. The unixutils package contains some good ones, but they aren't \
    portable to Windows. This library just repackages the Cabal implementations of its own \
    temporary file and folder functions so that you can use them without linking against Cabal \
    or depending on it being installed.

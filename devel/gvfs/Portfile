description     The Gnome Virtual File System.

long_description gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed \
                to work with the i/o abstractions of gio (a new \
                library available with glib). It installs several \
                modules that are automatically used by applications \
                using the APIs of libgio. The gvfs model differs \
                from e.g. gnome-vfs in that filesystems must be \
                mounted before they are used. There is a central \
                daemon (gvfsd) that handles coordinting mounts, and \
                then each mount is (typically) in its own daemon \
                process (although mounts can share daemon process). \
                gvfs comes with a set of backends, including trash \
                support, sftp, smb, http, dav and others. There is \
                a set of command line programs starting with gvfs- \
                that lets you run commands (like cat, ls, stat, etc) \
                on files in the gvfs.

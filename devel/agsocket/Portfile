description		yet another BSD sockets framework for use in Cocoa applications
long_description	AGSocket is yet another BSD sockets framework for \
					use in Cocoa applications. The primary class is \
					AGSocket, this can be used for TCP sockets, UDP \
					sockets, raw sockets, whatever. Additionally several \
					socket address classes are included, notably \
					AGInetSocketAddress for vanilla Internet socket \
					addresses. Unlike some of the other excellent \
					sockets frameworks already available, AGSocket is \
					primarily designed for asynchronous I/O thanks to \
					the underlying CFSocket API (though there's nothing \
					stopping you from using it for normal synchronous \
					I/O if you are so inclined).

description         Lift control operations, like exception catching, through monad transformers
long_description    \
    This package defines the type class MonadBaseControl, a subset of MonadBase \
    into which generic control operations such as catch can be lifted from IO \
    or any other base monad. Instances are based on monad transformers in \
    MonadTransControl, which includes all standard monad transformers in the \
    transformers library except ContT. \
    \nSee the lifted-base package which uses monad-control to lift IO operations \
    from the base library (like catch or bracket) into any monad that is an \
    instance of MonadBase or MonadBaseControl.

description         scc is a very fast & accurate code counter with \
                    complexity calculations and COCOMO estimates written in \
                    pure Go

long_description    Succinct Code Counter: scc is a tool for counting the \
                    physical lines of code, blank lines, and comment lines \
                    in the source code of many programming languages. \
                    Its goal is to be the fastest code counter \
                    possible, but also perform COCOMO calculation like \
                    sloccount and to estimate code complexity similar to \
                    cyclomatic complexity calculators. In short one tool to \
                    rule them all.

description      Generates assembly language code at run-time
long_description \
	GNU lightning is a library that generates assembly \
	language code at run-time. It is very fast, making \
	it ideal for Just-In-Time compilers, and it a\
	bstracts over the target CPU, as it exposes to the \
	clients a standardized RISC instruction set \
	inspired by the MIPS and SPARC chips.

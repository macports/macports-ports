description         Automatically configures software for compilation
long_description    Autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros \
                    that produce shell scripts to automatically \
                    configure software source code packages. These \
                    scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of \
                    UNIX-like systems without manual user \
                    intervention. Autoconf creates a configuration \
                    script for a package from a template file that \
                    lists the operating system features that the \
                    package can use, in the form of m4 macro calls.

# The system m4 is quite outdated due to Apple's no GPLv3 policy, and
# seems to have an issue that causes an error when autoconf tries to
# print warnings. So we now always use the m4 port.

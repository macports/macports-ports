description         common structures and low-level operations library

long_description    libHX is a C library (with some C++ bindings \
                    available) that provides data structures \
                    and functions commonly needed, such as \
                    maps, deques, linked lists, string \
                    formatting and autoresizing, option and \
                    config file parsing, type checking casts \
                    and more. libHX aids in quickly writing \
                    up C and C++ data processing programs, by \
                    consolidating tasks that often happen to be \
                    open-coded, such as (simple) config file \
                    reading, option parsing, directory traversal, \
                    and others, into a library. The focus is on \
                    reducing the amount of time (and secondarily, \
                    the amount of code) a developer has to spend \
                    for otherwise implementing such.

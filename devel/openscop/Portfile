long_description    OpenScop is an open specification defining a file format and a set of data structures to represent a static control part \
                    (SCoP for short), i.e., a program part that can be represented in the polyhedral model. The goal of OpenScop is to \
                    provide a common interface to various polyhedral compilation tools in order to simplify their interaction. The OpenScop aim \
                    is to provide a stable, unified format that offers a durable guarantee that a tool can use an output or provide an input to another \
                    tool without breaking a tool chain because of some internal changes in one element of the chain. The other promise of OpenScop is the \
                    ability to assemble or replace the basic blocks of a polyhedral compilation framework at no, or at least low engineering cost. \
                    The OpenScop Library, a.k.a. osl, is an example implementation of the specification licensed under the 3-clause BSD license so developers \
                    may feel free to use it in their code (either by linking it or copy-pasting its code).

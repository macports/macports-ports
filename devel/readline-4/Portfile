description	Library that provides command line editing
long_description\
		The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions	\
		for use by applications that allow users to edit	\
		command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs and vi	\
		editing modes are available. The Readline library	\
		includes additional functions to maintain a list of	\
 		previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps	\
		reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history	\
		expansion on previous commands.

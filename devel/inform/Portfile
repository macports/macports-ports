# The install of inform will build the executable to name-version and make a
# sym link to name. This causes two problems. The sym link is not relative to
# the bin directory making it link to the files in the dports directory which
# do not exists after install. Also the name-version the package uses is
# different then the name-version this Portfile uses so I had to make a special
# variable for this. Then fix the sym link to be relative.

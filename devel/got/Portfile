description         Game of Trees (Got)
long_description    Game of Trees is a version control system which \
                    prioritizes ease of use and simplicity over flexibility. \
                    Got uses Git repositories to store versioned data. \
                    Git can be used for any functionality which has \
                    not yet been implemented in Got. It will always be \
                    possible to work with both Got and Git on the same \
                    repository.

# There is probably a smarter way to do this, see failed attempts at
# https://trac.macports.org/ticket/69827
# So, if you, like me, are using LibreSSL, remove the port:libretls line
# as that is only required for OpenSSL users to supply libtls which is
# already included with LibreSSL.

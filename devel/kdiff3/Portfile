description         kdiff3 is a file comparing and merging tool.
long_description    kdiff3 compares two or three input files and shows the \
                    differences line by line and character by character. It \
                    provides an automatic merge facility and an integrated \
                    editor for comfortable solving of merge conflicts. \
                    kdiff3 allows recursive directory comparison and merging \
                    as well.

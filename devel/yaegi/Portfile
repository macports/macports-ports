description         Yaegi is Another Elegant Go Interpreter

long_description    Yaegi is Another Elegant Go Interpreter. It powers \
                    executable Go scripts and plugins, in embedded \
                    interpreters or interactive shells, on top of the Go \
                    runtime. It has complete support for the Go \
                    specification, is written in Pure Go, and works \
                    everywhere Go works. All Go & runtime resources \
                    accessible from script (with control), and for security, \
                    "unsafe" and "syscall" packages are neither used nor \
                    exported by default.

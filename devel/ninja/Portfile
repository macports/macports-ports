description         Small build system with a focus on speed.

long_description    Ninja is yet another build system. It takes as input    \
                    the interdependencies of files (typically source code   \
                    and output executables) and orchestrates building them, \
                    quickly.                                                \
                                                                            \
                    Ninja joins a sea of other build systems. Its           \
                    distinguishing goal is to be fast. It is born from my   \
                    work on the Chromium browser project, which has over    \
                    30,000 source files and whose other build systems       \
                    (including one built from custom non-recursive          \
                    Makefiles) can take ten seconds to start building       \
                    after changing one file. Ninja is under a second.

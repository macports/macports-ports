description         native macOS dialogs for scripting languages

long_description    ${name} is a macOS application for creating native \
                    dialog windows from almost any programming language. \
                    Typically, it is used with languages that have no \
                    or only limited support for graphic user interfaces \
                    on macOS, such as AppleScript, Bash scripts, \
                    JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Tcl and others.

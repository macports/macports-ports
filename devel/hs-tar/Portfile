description         Reading, writing and manipulating \".tar\" archive files.
long_description    \
    This library is for working with \".tar\" archive files. It can read and \
    write a range of common variations of archive format including V7, USTAR, \
    POSIX and GNU formats. It provides support for packing and unpacking \
    portable archives. This makes it suitable for distribution but not backup \
    because details like file ownership and exact permissions are not \
    preserved.

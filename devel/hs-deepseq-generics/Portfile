description         A GHC.Generics-based package providing a rnf implementation
long_description    \
    This package provides a GHC.Generics-based \
    Control.DeepSeq.Generics.genericRnf function which can be used for \
    providing a rnf implementation. See the documentation for the genericRnf \
    function in the Control.DeepSeq.Generics module to get started. \
    \
    The original idea was pioneered in the generic-deepseq package \
    (see http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2012-February/099551.html \
    for more information). \
    \
    This package differs from the generic-deepseq package by working in \
    combination with the existing deepseq package as opposed to defining \
    a conflicting drop-in replacement for deepseq's Control.Deepseq module. \
    \
    Note: The ability to auto-derive via GHC.Generics has been merged into \
    deepseq-1.4.0.0. This package is now still useful for writing code that's \
    also compatible with older deepseq versions not yet providing \
    GHC.Generics-support.

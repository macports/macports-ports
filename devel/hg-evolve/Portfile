long_description        Additional history rewriting commands for Mercurial \
                        for faster and safer mutable history. The extension \
                        offers a safe and simple way to refine changesets \
                        locally and propagate those changes to other \
                        repositories. The complex issues that can arise from \
                        exchanging draft changesets are automatically \
                        detected and handled, and it possible's for multiple \
                        developers to safely rewrite the same parts of history \
                        in a distributed way.

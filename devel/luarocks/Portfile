description             Manager for \"rocks\", lua extensions.
long_description        LuaRocks is a deployment and management system for Lua modules. \
				LuaRocks allows you to install Lua modules as self-contained packages \
				called \"rocks\", which also contain version dependency information. This \
				information is used both at install time, so that when one rock is \
				requested all rocks it depends on are installed as well, and at run \
				time, so that when a module is required, the correct version is loaded. \
				LuaRocks supports both local and remote repositories, and multiple local \
				rocks trees.

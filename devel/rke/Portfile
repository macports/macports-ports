description         Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE), an extremely simple, \
                    lightning fast Kubernetes distribution that runs \
                    entirely within containers.
long_description    Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified \
                    Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within \
                    Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and \
                    virtualized servers. RKE solves the problem of \
                    installation complexity, a common issue in the \
                    Kubernetes community.  With RKE, the installation \
                    and operation of Kubernetes is both simplified and \
                    easily automated, and it’s entirely independent of \
                    the operating system and platform you’re running. \
                    As long as you can run a supported version of \
                    Docker, you can deploy and run Kubernetes with RKE.

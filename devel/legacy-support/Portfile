# NOTE: Update this comment on the next release (C++ tests are gone).
#
# This port doesn't use C++ at all, except for a couple of tests which may
# fail to build with a non-OS-default stdlib setting.  Since the cxx_stdlib
# selection is unimportant for the tests (which are actually only testing
# the C-only interface to the library), we disable the cxx_stlib setting.
# This also avoids depending on a MacPorts compiler in some OS versions.

    To help make sure your system continues to be well-represented by\
    MacPorts, especially if your system is not one of the latest macOS\
    releases, please consider installing mpstats.  It will periodically\
    send an anonymous synopsis of your OS settings and installed ports.\
    The information provided by this is useful to help determine how\
    resources are allocated.

    You can install mpstats like this:    sudo port install mpstats

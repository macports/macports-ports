description             Manipulating Haskell source: abstract syntax, lexer, parser, and pretty-printer
long_description        \
    Haskell-Source with Extensions (HSE, haskell-src-exts) is an extension of \
    the standard haskell-src package, and handles most registered syntactic \
    extensions to Haskell, including: Multi-parameter type classes with \
    functional dependencies, Indexed type families (including associated \
    types), Empty data declarations, GADTs, Implicit parameters Template \
    Haskell and a few more. All extensions implemented in GHC are supported. \
    Apart from these standard extensions, it also handles regular patterns as \
    per the HaRP extension as well as HSX-style embedded XML syntax.

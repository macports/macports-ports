description         Generic finger-tree structure, with example instances
long_description    \
    A general sequence representation with arbitrary annotations, for use as \
    a base for implementations of various collection types, with examples, as \
    described in section 4 of Ralf Hinze and Ross Paterson, \"Finger trees: \
    a simple general-purpose data structure\", Journal of Functional \
    Programming 16:2 (2006) pp 197-217. For a tuned sequence type, see \
    Data.Sequence in the containers package, which is a specialization of this \
    structure.

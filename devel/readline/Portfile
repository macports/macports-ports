description	Library that provides command line editing
long_description	 The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by \
 			 applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed \
 			 in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline \
 			 library includes additional functions to maintain a list of \
 			 previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those \
 			 lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.

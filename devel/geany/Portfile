description     A fast and lightweight GTK+ IDE

long_description \
    Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development \
    environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast \
    IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. \
    Another goal was to be as independent as possible from a \
    special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME.

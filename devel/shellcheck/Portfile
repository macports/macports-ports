description         ShellCheck, a static analysis tool for shell scripts
long_description    \
    The goals of ShellCheck are: \
    \n - To point out and clarify typical beginner's syntax issues, that causes a shell to give cryptic error messages. \
    \n - To point out and clarify typical intermediate level semantic problems, that causes a shell to behave strangely and counter-intuitively. \
    \n - To point out subtle caveats, corner cases and pitfalls, that may cause an advanced user's otherwise working script to fail under future circumstances.

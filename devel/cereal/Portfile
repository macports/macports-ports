description         A C++11 library for serialization
long_description    \
    cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library. cereal takes \
    arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into different \
    representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON. cereal \
    was designed to be fast, light-weight, and easy to extend - it has no \
    external dependencies and can be easily bundled with other code or used \
    standalone.

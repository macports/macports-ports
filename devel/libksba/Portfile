long_description \
    Libksba is a library to make the tasks of working with \
    X.509 certificates, CMS data and related objects more easy. It \
    a highlevel interface to the implemented protocols and presents \
    the data in a consistent way. There is no more need to worry \
    about all the nasty details of the protocols. The API gives the \
    C programmer an easy way of interacting with the data. It copes \
    with the version details X.509 protocols tend to have as well as \
    with the many different versions and dialects. Applications \
    must usually cope with all of this and it has to be coded over \
    and over again. Libksba hides this by providing just one \
    API which does the Right Thing.

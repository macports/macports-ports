long_description \
	Libksba is a library to make the tasks of working with \
	X.509 certificates, CMS data and related objects more easy. It \
	a highlevel interface to the implemented protocols and presents \
	the data in a consistent way. There is no more need to worry \
	about all the nasty details of the protocols. The API gives the \
	C programmer an easy way of interacting with the data. It copes \
	with the version details X.509 protocols tend to have as well as \
	with the many different versions and dialects. Applications \
	must usually cope with all of this and it has to be coded over \
	and over again. Libksba hides this by providing just one \
	API which does the Right Thing.

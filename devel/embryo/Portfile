description             A C like scripting language

long_description        Embryo implements a C like scripting language \
                        used in various parts of the Enlightenment project, \
                        namely Edje. Embryo\'s scripting language is based \
                        on CompuPhase\'s Small language that was introduced \
                        in Dr Dobb\'s Journal in 1999. Embryo allows scripting \
                        capabilities in places that otherwise wouldnt \
                        support basic programming structures such as in Edje EDCs.

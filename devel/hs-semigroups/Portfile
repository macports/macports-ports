description         Haskell 98 semigroups
long_description    \
    In mathematics, a semigroup is an algebraic structure consisting of a set \
    together with an associative binary operation. A semigroup generalizes \
    a monoid in that there might not exist an identity element. It also \
    (originally) generalized a group (a monoid with all inverses) to a type \
    where every element did not have to have an inverse, thus the name \
    semigroup.

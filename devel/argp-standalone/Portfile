description         Standalone version of arguments parsing functions from GLIBC
long_description    It is standalone version of argp - part of glibc library. \
                    \
                    It was separated off glibc by Niels Myller. Niels primary use \
                    it for inclusion in the LSH distribution, but it's useful for \
                    any package that wants to use argp and at the same time be \
                    portable to non-glibc systems. \
                    \
                    Besides portability fixes, there are a few other changes in \
                    this version. The most important is that it no longer builds \
                    upon getopt\; the one or two hairy functions of GNU getopt are \
                    incorporated with the argp parser. There are no longer any global \
                    variables keeping track of the parser state.

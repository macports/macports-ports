# gtk-doc theoretically depends on port:openjade, port:docbook-xml,
# port:docbook-xsl and possibly more. The developers of the Gtk Mac OS X
# port advise to deactivate openjade support with this patch. Currently,
# the docbook packages do not register themselves in the catalog, so this
# is really our only possiblity for now. The package itself it needed for
# gtkdocize to succeed. Dependencies will have gtk-doc disabled for now.
# Call it crippled, it's there at least.

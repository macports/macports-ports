description       A modern C++ library providing numerical abstractions
long_description  The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) is a modern C++ library \
                  providing numerical abstractions especially targeted at \
                  applications in the field of analysis and verification of \
                  complex systems. The PPL can handle all the convex \
                  polyhedra that can be defined as the intersection of a \
                  finite number of (open or closed) hyperspaces, each \
                  described by an equality or inequality (strict or \
                  non-strict) with rational coefficients. The PPL also \
                  handles restricted classes of polyhedra that offer \
                  interesting complexity/precision tradeoffs. The library \
                  also supports finite powersets of (any kind of) polyhedra \
                  and linear programming problems solved with an \
                  exact-arithmetic version of the simplex algorithm.

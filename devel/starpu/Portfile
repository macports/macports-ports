description         Unified runtime system for heterogeneous multicore architectures
long_description    StarPU is a runtime system that offers support for heterogeneous multicore machines. \
                    While many efforts are devoted to design efficient computation kernels \
                    for those architectures (e.g. to implement BLAS kernels on GPUs), StarPU \
                    not only takes care of offloading such kernels (and implementing data coherency \
                    across the machine), but it also makes sure the kernels are executed as efficiently as possible.

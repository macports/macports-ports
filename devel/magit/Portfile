long_description \
    Magit is an interface to Git for Emacs. Unlike Emacs's native \
    version control support, Magit can take advantage of Git's \
    native features without breaking compatibility with other \
    systems. \
    \
    With Magit, you can inspect and modify your Git repositories with \
    Emacs. You can review and commit the changes you have made to the \
    tracked files, for example, and you can browse the history of past \
    changes. There is support for cherry picking, reverting, merging, \
    rebasing, and other common Git operations.

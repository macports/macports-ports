 Basic Installation
 ==================
 
-   The ‘configure’ shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+   Briefly, the shell command `./configure && make && make install'
+should configure, build, and install this package.  The following
+more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
+instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
+`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
+below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
+necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
+in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
+
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
 various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
-those values to create a ‘Makefile’ in each directory of the package.
-It may also create one or more ‘.h’ files containing system-dependent
-definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script ‘config.status’ that
-you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
-‘config.cache’ that saves the results of its tests to speed up
-reconfiguring, and a file ‘config.log’ containing compiler output
-(useful mainly for debugging ‘configure’).
+those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
+file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
+debugging `configure').
+
+   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
+and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
+the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
+disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
+cache files.
 
    If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
-to figure out how ‘configure’ could check whether to do them, and mail
-diffs or instructions to the address given in the ‘README’ so they can
-be considered for the next release.  If at some point ‘config.cache’
-contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
-
-   The file ‘configure.ac’ is used to create ‘configure’ by a program
-called ‘autoconf’.  You only need ‘configure.ac’ if you want to change
-it or regenerate ‘configure’ using a newer version of ‘autoconf’.
-
-The simplest way to compile this package is:
-
-  1. ‘cd’ to the directory containing the package's source code and type
-     ‘./configure’ to configure the package for your system.  If you're
-     using ‘csh’ on an old version of System V, you might need to type
-     ‘sh ./configure’ instead to prevent ‘csh’ from trying to execute
-     ‘configure’ itself.
-
-     Running ‘configure’ takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
-     messages telling which features it is checking for.
-
-  2. Type ‘make’ to compile the package.
-
-  3. Optionally, type ‘make check’ to run any self-tests that come with
-     the package.
-
-  4. Type ‘make install’ to install the programs and any data files and
-     documentation.
-
-  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
-     source code directory by typing ‘make clean’.  To also remove the
-     files that ‘configure’ created (so you can compile the package for
-     a different kind of computer), type ‘make distclean’.  There is
-     also a ‘make maintainer-clean’ target, but that is intended mainly
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
+some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
+may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
+`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
+you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
+of `autoconf'.
+
+   The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
+
+     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
+     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.
+
+  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
+     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
+     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
+     privileges.
+
+  5. Optionally, type `make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but
+     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
+     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
+     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install' required
+     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
+     correctly.
+
+  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
+     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
      for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
      all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
      with the distribution.
 
+  7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
+     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
+     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
+     GNU Coding Standards.
+
+  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide `make
+     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other
+     targets like `make install' and `make uninstall' work correctly.
+     This target is generally not run by end users.
+
 Compilers and Options
 =====================
 
    Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
-the ‘configure’ script does not know about.  You can give ‘configure’
-initial values for variables as arguments.  You can do it like this:
-     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix
+the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
+for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
+
+   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
+by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
+is an example:
+
+     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
+
+   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
 
 Compiling For Multiple Architectures
 ====================================
 
    You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
 same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
-own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of ‘make’ that
-supports the ‘VPATH’ variable, such as GNU ‘make’.  ‘cd’ to the
+own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
 directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
-the ‘configure’ script.  ‘configure’ automatically checks for the
-source code in the directory that ‘configure’ is in and in ‘..’.
-
-   If you have to use a ‘make’ that does not supports the ‘VPATH’
-variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
-in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
-one architecture, use ‘make distclean’ before reconfiguring for another
-architecture.
+the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  This
+is known as a "VPATH" build.
+
+   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
+architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
+installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
+reconfiguring for another architecture.
 
    On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
 executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
-"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple '-arch' options to the
-compiler but only a single '-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
+"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
+compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
 this:
 
      ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
                  CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
                  CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E"

 Installation Names
 ==================
 
-   By default, ‘make install’ will install the package's files in
-‘/usr/local/bin’, ‘/usr/local/man’, etc.  You can specify an
-installation prefix other than ‘/usr/local’ by giving ‘configure’ the
-option ‘--prefix=PATH’.
+   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
+`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
+can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
+`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
+absolute file name.
 
    You can specify separate installation prefixes for
 architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
-give ‘configure’ the option ‘--exec-prefix=PATH’, the package will use
-PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
-Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.
+pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
+PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
 
    In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
-options like ‘--bindir=PATH’ to specify different values for particular
-kinds of files.  Run ‘configure --help’ for a list of the directories
-you can set and what kinds of files go in them.
-
-   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
-with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving ‘configure’ the
-option ‘--program-prefix=PREFIX’ or ‘--program-suffix=SUFFIX’.
-
-Enabling Relocatability
-=======================
-
-   It has been a pain for many users of GNU packages for a long time
-that packages are not relocatable.  It means a user cannot copy a
-program, installed by another user on the same machine, to his home
-directory, and have it work correctly (including i18n).  So many users
-need to go through ‘configure; make; make install’ with all its
-dependencies, options, and hurdles.
-
-   Red Hat, Debian, and similar package systems solve the "ease of
-installation" problem, but they hardwire path names, usually to ‘/usr’
-or ‘/usr/local’.  This means that users need root privileges to install
-a binary package, and prevents installing two different versions of the
-same binary package.
-
-   A relocatable program can be moved or copied to a different location
-on the filesystem.  It is possible to make symlinks to the installed
-and moved programs, and invoke them through the symlink. It is possible
-to do the same thing with a hard link _only_ if the hard link file is
-in the same directory as the real program.
-
-   To configure a program to be relocatable, add ‘--enable-relocatable’
-to the ‘configure’ command line.
-
-   On some OSes the executables remember the location of shared
-libraries and prefer them over any other search path.  Therefore, such
-an executable will look for its shared libraries first in the original
-installation directory and only then in the current installation
-directory.  Thus, for reliability, it is best to also give a ‘--prefix’
-option pointing to a directory that does not exist now and which never
-will be created, e.g.  ‘--prefix=/nonexistent’.  You may use
-‘DESTDIR=DEST-DIR’ on the ‘make’ command line to avoid installing into
-that directory.
-
-   We do not recommend using a prefix writable by unprivileged users
-(e.g. ‘/tmp/inst$$’) because such a directory can be recreated by an
-unprivileged user after the original directory has been removed.  We
-also do not recommend prefixes that might be behind an automounter
-(e.g. ‘$HOME/inst$$’) because of the performance impact of directory
-searching.
-
-   Here's a sample installation run that takes into account all these
-recommendations:
-
-     ./configure --enable-relocatable --prefix=/nonexistent
-     make
-     make install DESTDIR=/tmp/inst$$
-
-   Installation with ‘--enable-relocatable’ will not work for setuid or
-setgid executables, because such executables search only system library
-paths for security reasons.  Also, installation with
-‘--enable-relocatable’ might not work on OpenBSD, when the package
-contains shared libraries and libtool versions 1.5.xx are used.
-
-   The runtime penalty and size penalty are negligible on GNU/Linux
-(just one system call more when an executable is launched), and small on
-other systems (the wrapper program just sets an environment variable
-and executes the real program).
+options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
+default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
+specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+`make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, `make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
+but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
+time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
+makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
+the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
+However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
+shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
+method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
+at `configure' time.
 
 Optional Features
 =================
 
-   Some packages pay attention to ‘--enable-FEATURE’ options to
-‘configure’, where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
-They may also pay attention to ‘--with-PACKAGE’ options, where PACKAGE

-that other prefix is the same as the one now specified through --prefix.
+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
+execution of `make' will be.  For these packages, running `./configure
+--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
+overridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure
+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with `make V=0'.

 Specifying the System Type
 ==========================
 
-   There may be some features ‘configure’ can not figure out

 Sharing Defaults
 ================
 
-   If you want to set default values for ‘configure’ scripts to share,

 ==================
 
-   ‘configure’ recognizes the following options to control how it

+variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
+them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
+
+     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
+
+causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
+overridden in the site shell script).
+
+Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to

+Inc.
 
-   This package depends on a few other packages.  They are listed in
-the file ‘DEPENDENCIES’.  It is recommended to install the listed
-packages before installing this package.
+   Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,
+are permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright

+without warranty of any kind.
 
 Basic Installation
 ==================
 
-   The ‘configure’ shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+   Briefly, the shell command `./configure && make && make install'
+should configure, build, and install this package.  The following
+more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
+instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
+`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
+below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
+necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
+in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
+
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
 various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
-those values to create a ‘Makefile’ in each directory of the package.
-It may also create one or more ‘.h’ files containing system-dependent
-definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script ‘config.status’ that
-you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
-‘config.cache’ that saves the results of its tests to speed up
-reconfiguring, and a file ‘config.log’ containing compiler output
-(useful mainly for debugging ‘configure’).

+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
+file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
+debugging `configure').
+
+   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
+and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
+the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
+disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
+cache files.
 
    If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
-to figure out how ‘configure’ could check whether to do them, and mail
-diffs or instructions to the address given in the ‘README’ so they can
-be considered for the next release.  If at some point ‘config.cache’
-contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
-
-   The file ‘configure.ac’ is used to create ‘configure’ by a program
-called ‘autoconf’.  You only need ‘configure.ac’ if you want to change
-it or regenerate ‘configure’ using a newer version of ‘autoconf’.
-
-The simplest way to compile this package is:
-
-  1. ‘cd’ to the directory containing the package's source code and type
-     ‘./configure’ to configure the package for your system.  If you're
-     using ‘csh’ on an old version of System V, you might need to type
-     ‘sh ./configure’ instead to prevent ‘csh’ from trying to execute
-     ‘configure’ itself.
-
-     Running ‘configure’ takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
-     messages telling which features it is checking for.
-
-  2. Type ‘make’ to compile the package.
-
-  3. Optionally, type ‘make check’ to run any self-tests that come with
-     the package.
-
-  4. Type ‘make install’ to install the programs and any data files and
-     documentation.
-
-  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
-     source code directory by typing ‘make clean’.  To also remove the
-     files that ‘configure’ created (so you can compile the package for
-     a different kind of computer), type ‘make distclean’.  There is
-     also a ‘make maintainer-clean’ target, but that is intended mainly
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
+some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
+may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
+`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
+you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
+of `autoconf'.
+
+   The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
+
+     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
+     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.
+
+  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
+     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
+     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
+     privileges.
+
+  5. Optionally, type `make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but
+     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
+     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
+     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install' required
+     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
+     correctly.
+
+  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
+     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
      for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
      all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
      with the distribution.
 
+  7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
+     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
+     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
+     GNU Coding Standards.
+
+  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide `make
+     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other
+     targets like `make install' and `make uninstall' work correctly.
+     This target is generally not run by end users.
+
 Compilers and Options
 =====================
 
    Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
-the ‘configure’ script does not know about.  You can give ‘configure’
-initial values for variables as arguments.  You can do it like this:
-     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix
+the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
+for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
+
+   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
+by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
+is an example:
+
+     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
+
+   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
 
 Compiling For Multiple Architectures
 ====================================
 
    You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
 same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
-own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of ‘make’ that
-supports the ‘VPATH’ variable, such as GNU ‘make’.  ‘cd’ to the
+own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
 directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
-the ‘configure’ script.  ‘configure’ automatically checks for the
-source code in the directory that ‘configure’ is in and in ‘..’.
-
-   If you have to use a ‘make’ that does not supports the ‘VPATH’
-variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
-in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
-one architecture, use ‘make distclean’ before reconfiguring for another
-architecture.
+the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  This
+is known as a "VPATH" build.
+
+   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
+architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
+installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
+reconfiguring for another architecture.
 
    On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
 executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
-"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple '-arch' options to the
-compiler but only a single '-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
+"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
+compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
 this:
 
      ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
                  CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
                  CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E"

 Installation Names
 ==================
 
-   By default, ‘make install’ will install the package's files in
-‘/usr/local/bin’, ‘/usr/local/man’, etc.  You can specify an
-installation prefix other than ‘/usr/local’ by giving ‘configure’ the
-option ‘--prefix=PATH’.
+   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
+`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
+can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
+`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
+absolute file name.
 
    You can specify separate installation prefixes for
 architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
-give ‘configure’ the option ‘--exec-prefix=PATH’, the package will use
-PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
-Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.
+pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
+PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
 
    In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
-options like ‘--bindir=PATH’ to specify different values for particular
-kinds of files.  Run ‘configure --help’ for a list of the directories
-you can set and what kinds of files go in them.
-
-   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
-with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving ‘configure’ the
-option ‘--program-prefix=PREFIX’ or ‘--program-suffix=SUFFIX’.
-
-Enabling Relocatability
-=======================
-
-   It has been a pain for many users of GNU packages for a long time
-that packages are not relocatable.  It means a user cannot copy a
-program, installed by another user on the same machine, to his home
-directory, and have it work correctly (including i18n).  So many users
-need to go through ‘configure; make; make install’ with all its
-dependencies, options, and hurdles.
-
-   Red Hat, Debian, and similar package systems solve the "ease of
-installation" problem, but they hardwire path names, usually to ‘/usr’
-or ‘/usr/local’.  This means that users need root privileges to install
-a binary package, and prevents installing two different versions of the
-same binary package.
-
-   A relocatable program can be moved or copied to a different location
-on the filesystem.  It is possible to make symlinks to the installed
-and moved programs, and invoke them through the symlink. It is possible
-to do the same thing with a hard link _only_ if the hard link file is
-in the same directory as the real program.
-
-   To configure a program to be relocatable, add ‘--enable-relocatable’
-to the ‘configure’ command line.
-
-   On some OSes the executables remember the location of shared
-libraries and prefer them over any other search path.  Therefore, such
-an executable will look for its shared libraries first in the original
-installation directory and only then in the current installation
-directory.  Thus, for reliability, it is best to also give a ‘--prefix’
-option pointing to a directory that does not exist now and which never
-will be created, e.g.  ‘--prefix=/nonexistent’.  You may use
-‘DESTDIR=DEST-DIR’ on the ‘make’ command line to avoid installing into
-that directory.
-
-   We do not recommend using a prefix writable by unprivileged users
-(e.g. ‘/tmp/inst$$’) because such a directory can be recreated by an
-unprivileged user after the original directory has been removed.  We
-also do not recommend prefixes that might be behind an automounter
-(e.g. ‘$HOME/inst$$’) because of the performance impact of directory
-searching.
-
-   Here's a sample installation run that takes into account all these
-recommendations:
-
-     ./configure --enable-relocatable --prefix=/nonexistent
-     make
-     make install DESTDIR=/tmp/inst$$
-
-   Installation with ‘--enable-relocatable’ will not work for setuid or
-setgid executables, because such executables search only system library
-paths for security reasons.  Also, installation with
-‘--enable-relocatable’ might not work on OpenBSD, when the package
-contains shared libraries and libtool versions 1.5.xx are used.
-
-   The runtime penalty and size penalty are negligible on GNU/Linux
-(just one system call more when an executable is launched), and small on
-other systems (the wrapper program just sets an environment variable
-and executes the real program).
+options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
+default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
+specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+`make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, `make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
+but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
+time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
+makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
+the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
+However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
+shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
+method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
+at `configure' time.
 
 Optional Features
 =================
 
-   Some packages pay attention to ‘--enable-FEATURE’ options to
-‘configure’, where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
-They may also pay attention to ‘--with-PACKAGE’ options, where PACKAGE

-   For packages that use the GNU libiconv library, you can use the

-‘configure’ option ‘--with-libintl-prefix’ to specify the prefix you
-used while installing GNU gettext-runtime.  This option is not necessary if
-that other prefix is the same as the one now specified through --prefix.
+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
+execution of `make' will be.  For these packages, running `./configure
+--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
+overridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure
+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with `make V=0'.

 Sharing Defaults
 ================
 
-   If you want to set default values for ‘configure’ scripts to share,
-you can create a site shell script called ‘config.site’ that gives
-default values for variables like ‘CC’, ‘cache_file’, and ‘prefix’.
-‘configure’ looks for ‘PREFIX/share/config.site’ if it exists, then
-‘PREFIX/etc/config.site’ if it exists.  Or, you can set the
-‘CONFIG_SITE’ environment variable to the location of the site script.
-A warning: not all ‘configure’ scripts look for a site script.

-Operation Controls
+Defining Variables
 ==================
 
-   ‘configure’ recognizes the following options to control how it
+   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
+environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
+configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
+variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
+them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
+
+     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
+
+causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
+overridden in the site shell script).
+
+Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
+an Autoconf limitation.  Until the limitation is lifted, you can use
+this workaround:
+
+     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash
+
+`configure' Invocation
+======================
+
+   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
 operates.
 
-‘--cache-file=FILE’
-     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
-     ‘./config.cache’.  Set FILE to ‘/dev/null’ to disable caching, for
-     debugging ‘configure’.
-
-‘--help’
-     Print a summary of the options to ‘configure’, and exit.
-
-‘--quiet’
-‘--silent’
-‘-q’
+`--help'
+`-h'
+     Print a summary of all of the options to `configure', and exit.
+
+`--help=short'
+`--help=recursive'
+     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
+     `configure', and exit.  The `short' variant lists options used
+     only in the top level, while the `recursive' variant lists options
+     also present in any nested packages.
+
+`--version'
+`-V'
+     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
+     script, and exit.
+
+`--cache-file=FILE'
+     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
+     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
+     disable caching.
+
+`--config-cache'
+`-C'
+     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.
+
+`--quiet'
+`--silent'
+`-q'
      Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
-     suppress all normal output, redirect it to ‘/dev/null’ (any error
+     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
      messages will still be shown).
 
-‘--srcdir=DIR’
+`--srcdir=DIR'
      Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
-     ‘configure’ can determine that directory automatically.
-
-‘--version’
-     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the ‘configure’
-     script, and exit.
+     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
 
-‘configure’ also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
+`--prefix=DIR'
+     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names::
+     for more details, including other options available for fine-tuning
+     the installation locations.
+
+`--no-create'
+`-n'
+     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output
+     files.
 
+`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
+`configure --help' for more details.

-Prerequisites
-=============
+Copyright (C) 1994-1996, 1999-2002, 2004-2013 Free Software Foundation,
+Inc.
 
-   This package depends on a few other packages.  They are listed in
-the file ‘DEPENDENCIES’.  It is recommended to install the listed
-packages before installing this package.
+   Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,
+are permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright
+notice and this notice are preserved.  This file is offered as-is,
+without warranty of any kind.
 
 Basic Installation
 ==================
 
-   The ‘configure’ shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+   Briefly, the shell command `./configure && make && make install'
+should configure, build, and install this package.  The following
+more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
+instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
+`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
+below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
+necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
+in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
+
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
 various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
-those values to create a ‘Makefile’ in each directory of the package.
-It may also create one or more ‘.h’ files containing system-dependent
-definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script ‘config.status’ that
-you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
-‘config.cache’ that saves the results of its tests to speed up
-reconfiguring, and a file ‘config.log’ containing compiler output
-(useful mainly for debugging ‘configure’).

+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
+file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
+debugging `configure').
+
+   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
+and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
+the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
+disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
+cache files.
 
    If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
-to figure out how ‘configure’ could check whether to do them, and mail
-diffs or instructions to the address given in the ‘README’ so they can
-be considered for the next release.  If at some point ‘config.cache’
-contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
-
-   The file ‘configure.ac’ is used to create ‘configure’ by a program
-called ‘autoconf’.  You only need ‘configure.ac’ if you want to change
-it or regenerate ‘configure’ using a newer version of ‘autoconf’.
-
-The simplest way to compile this package is:
-
-  1. ‘cd’ to the directory containing the package's source code and type
-     ‘./configure’ to configure the package for your system.  If you're
-     using ‘csh’ on an old version of System V, you might need to type
-     ‘sh ./configure’ instead to prevent ‘csh’ from trying to execute
-     ‘configure’ itself.
-
-     Running ‘configure’ takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
-     messages telling which features it is checking for.
-
-  2. Type ‘make’ to compile the package.
-
-  3. Optionally, type ‘make check’ to run any self-tests that come with
-     the package.
-
-  4. Type ‘make install’ to install the programs and any data files and
-     documentation.
-
-  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
-     source code directory by typing ‘make clean’.  To also remove the
-     files that ‘configure’ created (so you can compile the package for
-     a different kind of computer), type ‘make distclean’.  There is
-     also a ‘make maintainer-clean’ target, but that is intended mainly
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
+some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
+may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
+`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
+you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
+of `autoconf'.
+
+   The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
+
+     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
+     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.
+
+  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
+     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
+     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
+     privileges.
+
+  5. Optionally, type `make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but
+     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
+     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
+     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install' required
+     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
+     correctly.
+
+  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
+     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
      for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
      all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
      with the distribution.
 
+  7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
+     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
+     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
+     GNU Coding Standards.
+
+  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide `make
+     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other
+     targets like `make install' and `make uninstall' work correctly.
+     This target is generally not run by end users.
+
 Compilers and Options
 =====================
 
    Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
-the ‘configure’ script does not know about.  You can give ‘configure’
-initial values for variables as arguments.  You can do it like this:
-     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix
+the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
+for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
+
+   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
+by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
+is an example:
+
+     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
+
+   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
 
 Compiling For Multiple Architectures
 ====================================
 
    You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
 same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
-own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of ‘make’ that
-supports the ‘VPATH’ variable, such as GNU ‘make’.  ‘cd’ to the
+own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
 directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
-the ‘configure’ script.  ‘configure’ automatically checks for the
-source code in the directory that ‘configure’ is in and in ‘..’.
-
-   If you have to use a ‘make’ that does not supports the ‘VPATH’
-variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
-in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
-one architecture, use ‘make distclean’ before reconfiguring for another
-architecture.
+the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  This
+is known as a "VPATH" build.
+
+   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
+architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
+installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
+reconfiguring for another architecture.
 
    On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
 executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
-"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple '-arch' options to the
-compiler but only a single '-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
+"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
+compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
 this:
 
      ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
                  CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
                  CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E"
 
-   This is not guaranteed to produce working output in all cases.  You

+using the `lipo' tool if you have problems.
 
 Installation Names
 ==================
 
-   By default, ‘make install’ will install the package's files in
-‘/usr/local/bin’, ‘/usr/local/man’, etc.  You can specify an
-installation prefix other than ‘/usr/local’ by giving ‘configure’ the
-option ‘--prefix=PATH’.
+   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
+`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
+can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
+`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
+absolute file name.
 
    You can specify separate installation prefixes for
 architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
-give ‘configure’ the option ‘--exec-prefix=PATH’, the package will use
-PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
-Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.
+pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
+PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
 
    In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
-options like ‘--bindir=PATH’ to specify different values for particular
-kinds of files.  Run ‘configure --help’ for a list of the directories
-you can set and what kinds of files go in them.
-
-   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
-with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving ‘configure’ the
-option ‘--program-prefix=PREFIX’ or ‘--program-suffix=SUFFIX’.
-
-Enabling Relocatability
-=======================
-
-   It has been a pain for many users of GNU packages for a long time
-that packages are not relocatable.  It means a user cannot copy a
-program, installed by another user on the same machine, to his home
-directory, and have it work correctly (including i18n).  So many users
-need to go through ‘configure; make; make install’ with all its
-dependencies, options, and hurdles.
-
-   Red Hat, Debian, and similar package systems solve the "ease of
-installation" problem, but they hardwire path names, usually to ‘/usr’
-or ‘/usr/local’.  This means that users need root privileges to install
-a binary package, and prevents installing two different versions of the
-same binary package.
-
-   A relocatable program can be moved or copied to a different location
-on the filesystem.  It is possible to make symlinks to the installed
-and moved programs, and invoke them through the symlink. It is possible
-to do the same thing with a hard link _only_ if the hard link file is
-in the same directory as the real program.
-
-   To configure a program to be relocatable, add ‘--enable-relocatable’
-to the ‘configure’ command line.
-
-   On some OSes the executables remember the location of shared
-libraries and prefer them over any other search path.  Therefore, such
-an executable will look for its shared libraries first in the original
-installation directory and only then in the current installation
-directory.  Thus, for reliability, it is best to also give a ‘--prefix’
-option pointing to a directory that does not exist now and which never
-will be created, e.g.  ‘--prefix=/nonexistent’.  You may use
-‘DESTDIR=DEST-DIR’ on the ‘make’ command line to avoid installing into
-that directory.
-
-   We do not recommend using a prefix writable by unprivileged users
-(e.g. ‘/tmp/inst$$’) because such a directory can be recreated by an
-unprivileged user after the original directory has been removed.  We
-also do not recommend prefixes that might be behind an automounter
-(e.g. ‘$HOME/inst$$’) because of the performance impact of directory
-searching.
-
-   Here's a sample installation run that takes into account all these
-recommendations:
-
-     ./configure --enable-relocatable --prefix=/nonexistent
-     make
-     make install DESTDIR=/tmp/inst$$
-
-   Installation with ‘--enable-relocatable’ will not work for setuid or
-setgid executables, because such executables search only system library
-paths for security reasons.  Also, installation with
-‘--enable-relocatable’ might not work on OpenBSD, when the package
-contains shared libraries and libtool versions 1.5.xx are used.
-
-   The runtime penalty and size penalty are negligible on GNU/Linux
-(just one system call more when an executable is launched), and small on
-other systems (the wrapper program just sets an environment variable
-and executes the real program).
+options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
+default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
+specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+`make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, `make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
+but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
+time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
+makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
+the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
+However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
+shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
+method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
+at `configure' time.
 
 Optional Features
 =================
 
-   Some packages pay attention to ‘--enable-FEATURE’ options to
-‘configure’, where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
-They may also pay attention to ‘--with-PACKAGE’ options, where PACKAGE
-is something like ‘gnu-as’ or ‘x’ (for the X Window System).  The

-used while installing GNU gettext-runtime.  This option is not necessary if
-that other prefix is the same as the one now specified through --prefix.
+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the

+--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
+overridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure
+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with `make V=0'.

 Specifying the System Type
 ==========================
 
-   There may be some features ‘configure’ can not figure out
-automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
-will run on.  Usually ‘configure’ can figure that out, but if it prints
-a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
-‘--host=TYPE’ option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
-type, such as ‘sun4’, or a canonical name with three fields:
+   There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out
+automatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package
+will run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the
+_same_ architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
+a message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
+`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
+type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:
+
      CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
 
-See the file ‘config.sub’ for the possible values of each field.  If
-‘config.sub’ isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
-need to know the host type.
-
-   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
-use the ‘--target=TYPE’ option to select the type of system they will
-produce code for and the ‘--build=TYPE’ option to select the type of
-system on which you are compiling the package.
+where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:
+
+     OS
+     KERNEL-OS
+
+   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
+`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
+need to know the machine type.
+
+   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
+use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
+produce code for.
+
+   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
+platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
+"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
+eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.
 
 Sharing Defaults
 ================
 
-   If you want to set default values for ‘configure’ scripts to share,
-you can create a site shell script called ‘config.site’ that gives
-default values for variables like ‘CC’, ‘cache_file’, and ‘prefix’.
-‘configure’ looks for ‘PREFIX/share/config.site’ if it exists, then
-‘PREFIX/etc/config.site’ if it exists.  Or, you can set the
-‘CONFIG_SITE’ environment variable to the location of the site script.
-A warning: not all ‘configure’ scripts look for a site script.

+A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
 
-Operation Controls
+Defining Variables
 ==================
 
-   ‘configure’ recognizes the following options to control how it
+   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
+environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
+configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
+variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
+them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
+
+     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
+
+causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
+overridden in the site shell script).
+
+Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
+an Autoconf limitation.  Until the limitation is lifted, you can use
+this workaround:
+
+     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash
+
+`configure' Invocation
+======================
+
+   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
 operates.
 
-‘--cache-file=FILE’
-     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
-     ‘./config.cache’.  Set FILE to ‘/dev/null’ to disable caching, for
-     debugging ‘configure’.
-
-‘--help’
-     Print a summary of the options to ‘configure’, and exit.
-
-‘--quiet’
-‘--silent’
-‘-q’
+`--help'
+`-h'
+     Print a summary of all of the options to `configure', and exit.
+
+`--help=short'
+`--help=recursive'
+     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
+     `configure', and exit.  The `short' variant lists options used
+     only in the top level, while the `recursive' variant lists options
+     also present in any nested packages.
+
+`--version'
+`-V'
+     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
+     script, and exit.
+
+`--cache-file=FILE'
+     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
+     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
+     disable caching.
+
+`--config-cache'
+`-C'
+     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.
+
+`--quiet'
+`--silent'
+`-q'
      Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
-     suppress all normal output, redirect it to ‘/dev/null’ (any error
+     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
      messages will still be shown).
 
-‘--srcdir=DIR’
+`--srcdir=DIR'
      Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
-     ‘configure’ can determine that directory automatically.
-
-‘--version’
-     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the ‘configure’
-     script, and exit.
+     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
 
-‘configure’ also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
+`--prefix=DIR'
+     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names::
+     for more details, including other options available for fine-tuning
+     the installation locations.
+
+`--no-create'
+`-n'
+     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output
+     files.
 
+`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
+`configure --help' for more details.

+# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
+# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
+# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)

+# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
+# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
+# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
+# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
+# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6.

+Installation Instructions
+*************************
 
-Prerequisites
-=============
+Copyright (C) 1994-1996, 1999-2002, 2004-2013 Free Software Foundation,
+Inc.
 
-   This package depends on a few other packages.  They are listed in
-the file ‘DEPENDENCIES’.  It is recommended to install the listed
-packages before installing this package.
+   Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,
+are permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright
+notice and this notice are preserved.  This file is offered as-is,
+without warranty of any kind.
 
 Basic Installation
 ==================
 
-   The ‘configure’ shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+   Briefly, the shell command `./configure && make && make install'
+should configure, build, and install this package.  The following
+more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
+instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
+`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
+below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
+necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
+in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
+
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
 various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
-those values to create a ‘Makefile’ in each directory of the package.
-It may also create one or more ‘.h’ files containing system-dependent
-definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script ‘config.status’ that
-you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
-‘config.cache’ that saves the results of its tests to speed up
-reconfiguring, and a file ‘config.log’ containing compiler output
-(useful mainly for debugging ‘configure’).
+those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
+file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
+debugging `configure').
+
+   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
+and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
+the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
+disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
+cache files.
 
    If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
-to figure out how ‘configure’ could check whether to do them, and mail
-diffs or instructions to the address given in the ‘README’ so they can
-be considered for the next release.  If at some point ‘config.cache’
-contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
-
-   The file ‘configure.ac’ is used to create ‘configure’ by a program
-called ‘autoconf’.  You only need ‘configure.ac’ if you want to change
-it or regenerate ‘configure’ using a newer version of ‘autoconf’.
-
-The simplest way to compile this package is:
-
-  1. ‘cd’ to the directory containing the package's source code and type
-     ‘./configure’ to configure the package for your system.  If you're
-     using ‘csh’ on an old version of System V, you might need to type
-     ‘sh ./configure’ instead to prevent ‘csh’ from trying to execute
-     ‘configure’ itself.
-
-     Running ‘configure’ takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
-     messages telling which features it is checking for.
-
-  2. Type ‘make’ to compile the package.
-
-  3. Optionally, type ‘make check’ to run any self-tests that come with
-     the package.
-
-  4. Type ‘make install’ to install the programs and any data files and
-     documentation.
-
-  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
-     source code directory by typing ‘make clean’.  To also remove the
-     files that ‘configure’ created (so you can compile the package for
-     a different kind of computer), type ‘make distclean’.  There is
-     also a ‘make maintainer-clean’ target, but that is intended mainly
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
+some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
+may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
+`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
+you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
+of `autoconf'.
+
+   The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
+
+     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
+     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.
+
+  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
+     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
+     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
+     privileges.
+
+  5. Optionally, type `make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but
+     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
+     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
+     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install' required
+     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
+     correctly.
+
+  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
+     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
      for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
      all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
      with the distribution.
 
+  7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
+     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
+     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
+     GNU Coding Standards.
+
+  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide `make
+     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other
+     targets like `make install' and `make uninstall' work correctly.
+     This target is generally not run by end users.
+
 Compilers and Options
 =====================
 
    Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
-the ‘configure’ script does not know about.  You can give ‘configure’
-initial values for variables as arguments.  You can do it like this:
-     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix
+the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
+for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
+
+   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
+by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
+is an example:
+
+     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
+
+   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
 
 Compiling For Multiple Architectures
 ====================================
 
    You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
 same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
-own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of ‘make’ that
-supports the ‘VPATH’ variable, such as GNU ‘make’.  ‘cd’ to the
+own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
 directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
-the ‘configure’ script.  ‘configure’ automatically checks for the
-source code in the directory that ‘configure’ is in and in ‘..’.
-
-   If you have to use a ‘make’ that does not supports the ‘VPATH’
-variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
-in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
-one architecture, use ‘make distclean’ before reconfiguring for another
-architecture.
+the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  This
+is known as a "VPATH" build.
+
+   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
+architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
+installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
+reconfiguring for another architecture.
 
    On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
 executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
-"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple '-arch' options to the
-compiler but only a single '-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
+"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
+compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
 this:
 
      ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
                  CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
                  CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E"

+using the `lipo' tool if you have problems.
 
 Installation Names
 ==================
 
-   By default, ‘make install’ will install the package's files in
-‘/usr/local/bin’, ‘/usr/local/man’, etc.  You can specify an
-installation prefix other than ‘/usr/local’ by giving ‘configure’ the
-option ‘--prefix=PATH’.
+   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
+`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
+can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
+`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
+absolute file name.
 
    You can specify separate installation prefixes for
 architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
-give ‘configure’ the option ‘--exec-prefix=PATH’, the package will use
-PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
-Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.
+pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
+PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
 
    In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
-options like ‘--bindir=PATH’ to specify different values for particular
-kinds of files.  Run ‘configure --help’ for a list of the directories
-you can set and what kinds of files go in them.
-
-   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
-with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving ‘configure’ the
-option ‘--program-prefix=PREFIX’ or ‘--program-suffix=SUFFIX’.
-
-Enabling Relocatability
-=======================
-
-   It has been a pain for many users of GNU packages for a long time
-that packages are not relocatable.  It means a user cannot copy a
-program, installed by another user on the same machine, to his home
-directory, and have it work correctly (including i18n).  So many users
-need to go through ‘configure; make; make install’ with all its
-dependencies, options, and hurdles.
-
-   Red Hat, Debian, and similar package systems solve the "ease of
-installation" problem, but they hardwire path names, usually to ‘/usr’
-or ‘/usr/local’.  This means that users need root privileges to install
-a binary package, and prevents installing two different versions of the
-same binary package.
-
-   A relocatable program can be moved or copied to a different location
-on the filesystem.  It is possible to make symlinks to the installed
-and moved programs, and invoke them through the symlink. It is possible
-to do the same thing with a hard link _only_ if the hard link file is
-in the same directory as the real program.
-
-   To configure a program to be relocatable, add ‘--enable-relocatable’
-to the ‘configure’ command line.
-
-   On some OSes the executables remember the location of shared
-libraries and prefer them over any other search path.  Therefore, such
-an executable will look for its shared libraries first in the original
-installation directory and only then in the current installation
-directory.  Thus, for reliability, it is best to also give a ‘--prefix’
-option pointing to a directory that does not exist now and which never
-will be created, e.g.  ‘--prefix=/nonexistent’.  You may use
-‘DESTDIR=DEST-DIR’ on the ‘make’ command line to avoid installing into
-that directory.
-
-   We do not recommend using a prefix writable by unprivileged users
-(e.g. ‘/tmp/inst$$’) because such a directory can be recreated by an
-unprivileged user after the original directory has been removed.  We
-also do not recommend prefixes that might be behind an automounter
-(e.g. ‘$HOME/inst$$’) because of the performance impact of directory
-searching.
-
-   Here's a sample installation run that takes into account all these
-recommendations:
-
-     ./configure --enable-relocatable --prefix=/nonexistent
-     make
-     make install DESTDIR=/tmp/inst$$
-
-   Installation with ‘--enable-relocatable’ will not work for setuid or
-setgid executables, because such executables search only system library
-paths for security reasons.  Also, installation with
-‘--enable-relocatable’ might not work on OpenBSD, when the package
-contains shared libraries and libtool versions 1.5.xx are used.
-
-   The runtime penalty and size penalty are negligible on GNU/Linux
-(just one system call more when an executable is launched), and small on
-other systems (the wrapper program just sets an environment variable
-and executes the real program).
+options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
+default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
+specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+`make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, `make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
+but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
+time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
+makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
+the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
+However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
+shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
+method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
+at `configure' time.
 
 Optional Features
 =================
 
-   Some packages pay attention to ‘--enable-FEATURE’ options to
-‘configure’, where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
-They may also pay attention to ‘--with-PACKAGE’ options, where PACKAGE
-is something like ‘gnu-as’ or ‘x’ (for the X Window System).  The

-   For packages that use the GNU libiconv library, you can use the

-that other prefix is the same as the one now specified through --prefix.

-‘configure’ option ‘--with-libintl-prefix’ to specify the prefix you
-used while installing GNU gettext-runtime.  This option is not necessary if
-that other prefix is the same as the one now specified through --prefix.
+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
+execution of `make' will be.  For these packages, running `./configure
+--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
+overridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure
+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with `make V=0'.

-   ‘configure’ recognizes the following options to control how it

+them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
+
+     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
+
+causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is

+# serial 5 lt~obsolete.m4
+
+# These exist entirely to fool aclocal when bootstrapping libtool.
+#
+# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN)
+# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
+# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
+#
+# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
+# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
+# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
+# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
+# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)
+#
+# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
+# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
+# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
+# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
+# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6. 
+#
+# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.
+# Yes, that means every name once taken will need to remain here until
+# we give up compatibility with versions before 1.7, at which point
+# we need to keep only those names which we still refer to.
+
+# This is to help aclocal find these macros, as it can't see m4_define.

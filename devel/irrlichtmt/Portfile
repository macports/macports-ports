# NOTE: There might be the argument to avoid conflicts if this might be possible.
#       However, this seems to be a more complex task and might not easily feasible.
# Rationale:  The Minetest core evidently binds to a specific IrrLichtMT fork version.
# The co-maintainer is not aware of any reasonable use case for different MT core versions
# being required as parallel install.  To the opposite this might confuse MT players greatly.
# Furthermore, a subport can be easily activated and deactivated without install like any port.

######
# START of the comprised 'subport' definitions to this Portfile.
###

# New and improved approach with several 'subport' definitions as follows:
#
# 1. MT 5.4 ports are using the 'irrlicht' port instead.  This is out of scope.
#
# 2. Subport 'irrlichtmt-mt55' provides 'irrlicht 1.9.0mt6' for MT 5.5.1 ports.
#
# 3. Subport 'irrlichtmt-mt56' provides 'irrlicht 1.9.0mt8' for MT 5.6.1 ports.
#
# 4. Subport 'irrlichtmt-mt57' provides 'irrlicht 1.9.0mt9' for MT 5.7.0 ports.
#
# 5. Subport 'irrlichtmt-mt58' would provide 'irrlicht 1.9.0mtX' for MT 5.8.0 ports.
#
# NOTE: The future of 'irrlicht 1.9.0mtX' might be unsure beyond MT 5.8 dev as
#       the MT core devs seek to fully integrate the former IrrLicht code into
#       their MT core code base and/or might have the goal of SDL2 apparently.

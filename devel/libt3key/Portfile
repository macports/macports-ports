description         \
    The ${name} library provides functions for retrieving the character \
    sequences used by terminals to represent keys pressed by the user.

long_description    \
    {*}${description} Although the terminfo database provides part of this \
    information, it lacks information for the sequences returned by modern \
    terminals\/terminal emulators for many combinations of modifiers with \
    other keys. For example, many terminal emulators provide separate \
    character sequences for Control combined with the cursor keys, which is \
    not stored in the terminfo database. Many programs contain their own \
    databases with this information. This library tries to be a database \
    usable by many programs, such that all programs can benefit from the \
    information collected.

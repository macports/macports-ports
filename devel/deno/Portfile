description         Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for \
                    JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in \
                    Rust.

long_description    Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. \
                    It is secure by default, performs no file, network, or \
                    environment access, unless explicitly enabled, and \
                    supports TypeScript out of the box. Deno has built-in \
                    utilities like a dependency inspector (deno info) and a \
                    code formatter (deno fmt), with a set of reviewed \
                    (audited) standard modules that are guaranteed to work \
                    with Deno.

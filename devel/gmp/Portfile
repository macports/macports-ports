description     GNU multiple precision arithmetic library
long_description \
    GNU MP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on\
    signed integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers. It   \
    has a rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular       \
    interface. GNU MP is designed to be as fast as possible, both for   \
    small operands and for huge operands. The speed is achieved by using\
    fullwords as the basic arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms, by\
    carefully optimized assembly code for the most common inner loops   \
    for a lots of CPUs, and by a general emphasis on speed (instead of  \
    simplicity or elegance).

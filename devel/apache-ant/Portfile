long_description	Ant is a Java based build tool. In theory it is kind of \
				like make without make's wrinkles. Ant uses XML build files \
				that define a set of targets. Each target has dependencies \
				(other targets) and contains a set of tasks to perform.

# Ant is installed from the binary (jar) distribution by default. Due to 
# bootstrapping issues, the source variant generally doesn't build a very
# usable ant: the ant tasks (such as junit) are non-functional as their
# dependent support isn't available when ant is built, due to circular
# dependencies back to ant.

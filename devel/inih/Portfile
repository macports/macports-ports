description             inih (INI Not Invented Here) is a simple .INI file parser written in C
long_description        It's only a couple of pages of code, and it was designed to be small and simple, \
                        so it's good for embedded systems. It's also more or less compatible with \
                        Python's ConfigParser style of .INI files, including RFC 822-style multi-line \
                        syntax and name: value entries.

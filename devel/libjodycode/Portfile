description         Library for imagepile, jdupes, winregfs, zeromerge.
long_description    ${name} is a software code library containing code \
                    shared among several of the programs written by \
                    Jody Bruchon such as imagepile, jdupes, winregfs, \
                    and zeromerge.

# The following patch adds the absolute path to -install_name, along
# with version numbers to -compatibility_version and -current version.
# This patch also renames the compiled library and symlinks to .dylib
# rather than .so.

# Disable use of Intel extensions, as they also require aligned_alloc.
# And latter only available for 10.14+ x86_64 anyway.

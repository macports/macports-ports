description         C library for multiple-precision floating-point \
                    computations
long_description    MPFR is a portable C library for arbitrary-precision \
                    binary floating-point computation with correct \
                    rounding, based on the GMP multiple-precision \
                    library. The computation is both efficient and \
                    has a well-defined semantics. It copies the good \
                    ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for \
                    fixed-precision floating-point arithmetic.

xcode_workaround.fixed_xcode_version 11.2

# Due to radr://10291355 (llvm.org PR11111), the new tls support enabled in clang with Xcode 4.2
# miscompiles mpfr. While this was fixed in Xcode 4.2.1, as the ttls support was never used prior to
# Xcode 4.2, the generic fix is to pass --disable-thread-safe to configure, however this will break
# any project that requires a thread-safe mpfr library, therefore the Xcode 4.2 compiler is
# blacklisted here

if {${os.platform} eq "darwin" && ${os.major} < 11} {

    # A multithreaded mpfr is possible on these systems by building with a

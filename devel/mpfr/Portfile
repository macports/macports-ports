description     C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations
long_description \
    MPFR is a portable C library for arbitrary-precision binary \
    floating-point computation with correct rounding, based on the GMP \
    multiple-precision library. The computation is both efficient and \
    has a well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the \
    ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for fixed-precision floating-point arithmetic.

description         Various packaging tools and scripts for LXQt applications

long_description \
    This repository is providing several tools needed to build LXQt itself as \
    well as other components maintained by the LXQt project. \
    \
    These tools used to be spread over the repositories of various other \
    components and were summarized to ease dependency management. So far many \
    components, in particular liblxqt, were representing a build dependency \
    without being needed themselves but only because their repository was \
    providing a subset of the tools which are now summarized here. So the use \
    of this repository will reduce superfluous and bloated dependencies.

platforms           darwin

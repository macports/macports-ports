long_description	\
		DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs.	\
		Its purpose is to provide a single front end for all	\
		tests. Think of it as a custom library of Tcl		\
		procedures crafted to support writing a test harness.	\
		A Test Harness is the testing infrastructure that is	\
		created to support a specific program or tool. Each	\
		program can have multiple testsuites, all supported	\
		by a single test harness.

description         A program for generating call graphs from C code.

long_description    The cflow program is a tool which generates a call graph \
                    from C source files. It is most often used with a program \
                    like dot (from the graphviz package) in order to present \
                    visual graphs of the paths along which a piece of software \
                    may run.

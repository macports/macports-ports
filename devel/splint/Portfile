description   Secure Programming Lint
long_description   Splint is a tool for statically checking C programs \
	           for security vulnerabilities and coding mistakes. \
 		   With minimal effort, Splint can be used as a better lint. \
		   If additional effort is invested adding annotations to \
		   programs, Splint can perform stronger checking than can \
		   be done by any standard lint.

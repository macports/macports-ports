long_description        This is the LibOFX library. It is a parser and an API \
                        designed to allow applications to very easily support \
                        OFX command responses, usually provided by financial \
                        institutions for statement downloads. To my knowledge, \
                        it is the first working OpenSource implementation of \
                        the OFX (Open Financial eXchange) specification on \
                        the client side.

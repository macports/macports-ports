description         small statistics and graphics package

long_description    Dap is a small statistics and graphics package based on C. \
                    Version 3.0 of Dap can read SBS programs! The user wishing \
                    to perform basic statistical analyses is now freed from \
                    learning and using C syntax for straightforward tasks, \
                    while retaining access to the C-style graphics and \
                    statistics features provided by the original \
                    implementation. Dap provides core methods of data \
                    management, analysis, and graphics that are commonly used \
                    in statistical consulting practice (univariate statistics, \
                    correlations and regression, ANOVA, categorical data \
                    analysis, logistic regression, and nonparametric analyses).

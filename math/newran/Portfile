description         This is a C++ library for generating sequences of random numbers from a wide variety of distributions.

long_description    {*}${description} It is particularly appropriate for the situation where one requires sequences \
                    of identically distributed random numbers since the set up time for each type of distribution \
                    is relatively long but it is efficient when generating each new random number. The library includes \
                    classes for generating random numbers from a number of distributions and is easily extended \
                    to be able to generate random numbers from almost any of the standard distributions.

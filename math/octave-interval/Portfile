description         The interval package for real-valued interval arithmetic provides \
                    data types and operations for verified computing.
long_description    ${description} It can be used to handle uncertainties, estimate \
                    arithmetic errors and produce reliable results. Also it can help \
                    find guaranteed solutions to numerical problems. Thanks to GNU MPFR \
                    many arithmetic operations are provided with best possible accuracy. \
                    The implementation of intervals in inf-sup format is based on \
                    interval boundaries represented by binary64 numbers and is standard \
                    conforming to IEEE 1788.

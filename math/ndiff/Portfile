long_description \
    ndiff assumes that you have two text files containing numerical     \
    values, and the two files are expected to be identical, or at least \
    numerically similar. ndiff allows you to specify absolute and/or    \
    relative error tolerances for differences between numerical values  \
    in the two files, and then reports only the lines with values       \
    exceeding those tolerances. It also tells you by how much they      \
    differ.

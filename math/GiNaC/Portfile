description     GiNaC is Not a Computer algebra system
long_description \
    Currently, GiNaC's capabilities include: \
        1. Very fast manipulation of large integers and \
           rationals owing to the CLN library (for instance, \
           it uses Karatsuba multiplication and \
           Schoenhage-Strassen multiplication for very large \
           integers). \
        2. Efficient handling of multivariate polynomials and \
           rational functions. \
        3. Support for linear algebra includes symbolic \
           matrices, vectors and solving equations. \
        4. Very fast heuristic polynomial GCD. \
        5. Many built in functions (sin, cos, atan, sinh, \
           factorial, etc.) \
        6. Symbolic differentiation and series expansion of \
           all built-in functions. \
        7. Several forms of output (also as optimized C++, \
           for numerical postprocessing). \
        8. Memory-efficiency and -safety through the internal \
           use of reference counting for all expressions.

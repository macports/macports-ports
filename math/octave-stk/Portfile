description         The STK is a (not so) Small Toolbox for Kriging.
long_description    {*}${description} Its primary focus in on the \
                    interpolation/regression technique known as kriging, which is very \
                    closely related to Splines and Radial Basis Functions, and can be \
                    interpreted as a non-parametric Bayesian method using a Gaussian \
                    Process (GP) prior. The STK also provides tools for the sequential \
                    and non-sequential design of experiments. Even though it is, \
                    currently, mostly geared towards the Design and Analysis of Computer \
                    Experiments (DACE), the  STK can be useful for other applications \
                    areas (such as Geostatistics, Machine Learning, Non-parametric \
                    Regression, etc.).

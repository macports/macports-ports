description         The STK is a (not so) Small Toolbox for Kriging.
long_description    ${description} Its primary focus in on the interpolation/regression \
                    technique known as kriging, which is very closely related to Splines \
                    and Radial Basis Functions, and can be interpreted as a \
                    non-parametric Bayesian method using a Gaussian Process (GP) prior. \
                    The STK also provides tools for the sequential and non-sequential \
                    design of experiments. Even though it is, currently, mostly geared \
                    towards the Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE), the \
                    STK can be useful for other applications areas (such as \
                    Geostatistics, Machine Learning, Non-parametric Regression, etc.).

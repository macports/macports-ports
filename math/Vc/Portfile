description         Portable, zero-overhead SIMD library for C++
long_description \
    Vc is a free software library to ease explicit vectorization of \
    C++ code. It has an intuitive API and provides portability \
    between different compilers and compiler versions as well as \
    portability between different vector instruction sets. Thus an \
    application written with Vc can be compiled for \n\
    AVX \n\
    SSE2 up to SSE4.2 \n\
    SSE4a, XOP, FMA4, and FMA \n\
    Scalar (fallback which works everywhere)
platforms           darwin

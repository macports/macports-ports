description             A solver for linear programs
long_description        Clp (Coin-or linear programming) is an open-source linear programming solver. \
                        \nIt is primarily meant to be used as a callable library, but a basic, stand-alone executable \
                        version is also available. It is designed to find solutions of mathematical optimization \
                        problems of the form \
                        \n\
                        \nminimize   c\'x \
                        \nsuch that  lhs <= Ax <= rhs \
                        \nand        lb  <=  x <= ub \
                        \n\
                        \nCLP includes primal and dual Simplex solvers. \
                        Both dual and primal algorithms can use matrix storage methods provided by the user (0-1 and \
                        network matrices are already supported in addition to the default sparse matrix). \
                        The dual algorithm has Dantzig and Steepest edge row pivot choices, new ones may be provided \
                        by the user. The same is true for the column pivot choice of the primal algorithm. \
                        The primal can also use a non linear cost which should work for piecewise linear convex \
                        functions. CLP also includes a barrier method for solving LPs.

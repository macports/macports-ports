long_description    Nickle is a programming language based prototyping environment \
                    with powerful programming and scripting capabilities. Nickle supports \
                    a variety of datatypes, especially arbitrary precision numbers. \
                    The programming language vaguely resembles C. Some things in C \
                    which do not translate easily are different, some design choices \
                    have been made differently, and a very few features are simply missing.

long_description    Nickle is a programming language based prototyping environment \
                    with powerful programming and scripting capabilities. Nickle supports \
                    a variety of datatypes, especially arbitrary precision numbers. \
                    The programming language vaguely resembles C. Some things in C \
                    which do not translate easily are different, some design choices \
                    have been made differently, and a very few features are simply missing.

# Nickle switched to generating tables for tests,
# and its script uses invalid syntax, which breaks
# math test. autotools buils cannot generate tables:
# fmt: illegal option -- -
# meson build generates broken tables:
# 11/22 math.5c FAIL 1.18s exit status 1
# math-tables.5c: syntax error before "exp"
# It is not enough to replace invalid --width with -width
# or alternatives, since lines with . are not handled
# correctly anyway. So unfortunately, we need to depend
# on coreutils here, which can handle linuxisms.

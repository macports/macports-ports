long_description    IBEX is a C++ library for constraint processing over real numbers.\
                    It provides reliable algorithms for handling non-linear constraints. In\
                    particular, roundoff errors are also taken into account. It is based on\
                    interval arithmetic and affine arithmetic. The main feature\
                    of Ibex is its ability to build strategies declaratively\
                    through the contractor programming paradigm. It can also be\
                    used as a black-box solver.

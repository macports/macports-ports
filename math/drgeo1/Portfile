description         Dr Geo is an interactive geometry software.

long_description    ${description} This means one can draw geometric figure \
    based on mathematic property but also can move part of the figure in \
    respect with its properties. \
    Dr Geo is an educational oriented software. It's an observatory to \
    explore geometry situation in an interactive way in opposition to \
    figure drawn on a sheet of paper. The user interface has been thing to \
    be simple but efficient for young users. In this idea, Dr Geo can also \
    handle different languages. It can can be used by mathematic teachers. \
    In a class room to make a show or in a computer class room. Also the \
    teacher can share Dr Geo with its students.

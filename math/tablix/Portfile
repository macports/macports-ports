description			Kernel for solving general timetabling problems
long_description \
 Tablix is a powerful free software kernel for solving general \
 timetabling problems. It uses a coarse-grained parallel genetic \
 algorithm in combination with other techniques to construct \
 sensible timetables from XML formatted problem descriptions. \
 Tablix supports a very wide range of timetabling \
 problems, from high school timetabling to barge scheduling. \
 A number of timetable constraints are already implemented \
 in the default installation and kernel's modular \
 design makes it is easy to add new ones.

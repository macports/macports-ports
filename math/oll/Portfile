long_description    OLL is a library supporting several for online-learning \
                    algorithms. OLL is specialized for large-scale, but sparse, \
                    learning tasks such as Natural Language Processing. While \
                    these algorithms are very efficient in terms of speed, and \
                    space (linear in the number of examples, and features), \
                    its performances are comparable to the batch-style learning \
                    methods such as SVMs, MEs.

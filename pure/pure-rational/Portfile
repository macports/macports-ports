description         a Pure port of Q+Q, Rob Hubbard's rational number library

long_description    ${name} is ${description}. \
                    It contains rational.pure, a collection of utility \
                    functions for rational numbers, and rat_interval.pure, \
                    a module for doing interval arithmetic needed by \
                    rational.pure. These modules are designed to work with \
                    the math.pure module (part of the standard Pure library), \
                    which contains the definition of Pure's rational type \
                    and implements the basic rational arithmetic.

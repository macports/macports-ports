description         Modern Fortran QUADPACK library for 1D numerical quadrature
long_description    QUADPACK is a Fortran library for the numerical computation \
                    of definite one-dimensional integrals (numerical quadrature). \
                    Development of this library, which had ceased in the 1980s, \
                    has been restarted. The original code is being modernized, \
                    and new methods are being added. The goal is a comprehensive \
                    and modern Fortran library that includes both classic \
                    and state-of-the-art methods for numerical integration.

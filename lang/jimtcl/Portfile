description         \
    Jim is a small footprint implementation of the Tcl programming language \
    written from scratch.

long_description    \
    {*}${description} Currently Jim Tcl is very feature complete with an \
    extensive test suite \(see the tests directory\).  There are some Tcl \
    commands and features which are not implemented \(and likely never will \
    be\), including traces and Tk. However, Jim Tcl offers a number of both \
    Tcl8.5 and Tcl8.6 features \(\{\*\}, dict, lassign, tailcall and optional \
    UTF-8 support\) and some unique features. These unique features include \
    \[lambda\] with garbage collection, a general GC\/references system, \
    arrays as syntax sugar for \[dict\]tionaries, object-based I/O and more. \
    Other common features of the Tcl programming language are present, like \
    the \"everything is a string\" behaviour, implemented internally as dual \
    ported objects to ensure that the execution time does not reflect the \
    semantic of the language

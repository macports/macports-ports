    functional programming language based on term rewriting

long_description \
    Pure is a functional programming language based on term rewriting. \
    It has a modern syntax featuring curried function applications, lexical \
    closures and equational definitions with pattern matching, and thus is \
    somewhat similar to languages of the Haskell and ML variety. But Pure is \
    also a very dynamic and reflective language, and is more like Lisp in \
    this respect. The interpreter has an LLVM backend to do JIT compilation, \
    hence programs run blazingly fast and interfacing to C modules is easy. \
    The libraries are licensed under LGPL-3, the interpreter is GPL-3, and \
    the examples are BSD-licensed.

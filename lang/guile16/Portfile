description	GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extension (guile)
long_description	\
		Guile is an interpreter for the Scheme programming	\
		language, packaged for use in a wide variety of		\
		environments. Guile implements Scheme as described in	\
		the Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme	\
		(usually known as R5RS), providing clean and general	\
		data and control structures.				\
									\
		Guile goes beyond the rather austere language presented	\
		in R5RS, extending it with a module system, full access	\
		to POSIX system calls, networking support, multiple	\
		threads, dynamic linking, a foreign function call	\
		interface, powerful string processing, and many other	\
		features needed for programming in the real world.

#bugs		On Apple's darwin, the putenv library function acts	\
#		differently than the GNU version. The patch to		\
#		libguile/posix.c fixes this, so the guile 'putenv'	\
#		function doesn't throw a system error.

#user_notes	You may need to set the environment variable		\
#		DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to /opt/local/lib (or wherever	\
#		the guile libraries have been installed) if you want	\
#		to load guile modules from an application linked with	\
#		libguile.  This should only apply to developers using	\
#		guile as an extension language.

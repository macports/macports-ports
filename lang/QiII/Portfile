long_description  Qi is a functional programming language developed \
                  by Dr Mark Tarver and introduced in April 2005. A \
                  new version was reimplemented and issued as Qi II \
                  in November 2008. The first version was free \
                  software, licensed under GPL. But, as GPL was \
                  perceived as unfriendly to commercial use, Qi II \
                  is available via two proprietary licenses: one for \
                  personal and educational use, and another for \
                  producing closed source software. \
                  Qi is written in Lisp. It includes most of the \
                  features common to modern functional programming \
                  languages such as pattern-matching, currying, partial \
                  applications, guards and (optional) static type checking.

description	The Clisp Common Lisp Implementation
long_description	\
		CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible, \
		formerly of Karlsruhe University, and Michael Stoll, \
		formerly of Munich University, both in Germany. \
		It mostly supports the Lisp described in the \
		ANSI Common Lisp standard. \
			CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, almost all \
		of CLOS, a foreign language interface and a socket interface. \
		An X11 interface is available through CLX and Garnet. \
		Command line editing is provided by readline.

#bugs		Version 2.29 is compatible with maxima 5.9.0. Version \
#		2.30 introduced floating point bugs that maxima trips \
#		over.

#user_notes	This port is intended to be used by other ports		\
#		requiring the features of the latest released gcc or	\
#		g++. For example, covariant returns in g++ are not	\
#		supported by the standard Apple g++-3.3, but are by	\
#		this version. Generally speaking, you'll know if you	\
#		need this.						\
#									\
#		The libraries are moved from their standard location	\
#		so as not to conflict with the libraries installed	\
#		by the system's gcc. It is necessary below to specify	\
#		the C++ include path explicitly (using the		\
#		--with-gxx-include-dir configure argument) because	\
#		of a bug in gcc-3.4.3 that causes incorrect include	\
#		paths to be generated if the library directory is	\
#		changed.

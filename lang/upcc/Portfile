description		extension of C for high performance parallel computing
long_description	\
Unified Parallel C (UPC) is an extension of the C programming language \
designed for high performance computing on large-scale parallel machines. The \
language provides a uniform programming model for both shared and distributed \
memory hardware. The programmer is presented with a single shared, partitioned \
address space, where variables may be directly read and written by any \
processor, but each variable is physically associated with a single processor. \
UPC uses a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model of computation in which \
the amount of parallelism is fixed at program startup time, typically with a \
single thread of execution per processor.

# gcxxml can be compiled with clang, but can't simulate clang. It should be able
# to simulate gcc*, but gets confused by header files in /usr/include. The
# default compiler it uses is the one used to compile it, so to get gccxml working
# without having to set any options it seems easier to do this:
configure.compiler  llvm-gcc-4.2
# XCode 5 doesn't include llvm-gcc-4.2, so make sure it is installed
depends_build-append bin:llvm-gcc-4.2:llvm-gcc42
# also need this compiler at runtime
depends_run-append  bin:llvm-gcc-4.2:llvm-gcc42

description         Camlp5 is a preprocessor-pretty-printer of OCaml.
long_description    Camlp5 is a preprocessor and pretty-printer for \
        OCaml programs. It also provides parsing and printing tools. \
        As a preprocessor, it allows to: extend the syntax of OCaml, \
        redefine the whole syntax of the language. As a pretty printer, \
        it allows to: display OCaml programs in an elegant way, convert \
        from one syntax to another, check the results of syntax \
        extensions. Camlp5 also provides some parsing and pretty \
        printing tools: extensible grammars, extensible printers, \
        stream parsers and lexers pretty print module.  It works as a \
        shell command and can also be used in the OCaml toplevel.

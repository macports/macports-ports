description         Scheme shell
long_description    Scsh is an open-source Unix shell embedded within \
                    Scheme.  Scsh is a variant of Scheme 48 (an R5RS \
                    compliant new-tech Scheme system) Scsh is designed \
                    for writing real-life standalone Unix programs and \
                    shell scripts. Scsh spans a wide range of application, \
                    from `script' applications usually handled with perl \
                    or sh, to more standard systems applications usually \
                    written in C.

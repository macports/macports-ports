description         A lightweight Perl 6-like language for virtual machines
long_description    This is "Not Quite Perl" -- a lightweight Perl 6-like \
                    environment for virtual machines. The key feature of \
                    NQP is that it ºs designed to be a very small environment \
                    (as compared with, say, perl6 or Rakudo) and is focused \
                    on being a high-level way to create compilers and \
                    libraries for virtual machines (such as the Parrot \
                    Virtual Machine, the JVM, and MoarVM).

# citation:
# NQP can run on three different backends: Parrot, MoarVM and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
# Decide on which backends you want it to run, and configure and build it as follows:
# --backends=moar,parrot,jvm
depends_lib-append  port:MoarVM

# Building rakudo on PPC results in malloc errors (though build still succeeds):
# nqp-m malloc: *** error for object 0x80a02ab0: incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.

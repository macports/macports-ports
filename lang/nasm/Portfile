description         NASM, the Netwide Assembler, is an 80x86 and x86-64 assembler

long_description    The Netwide Assembler, NASM, is an 80x86 and x86−64 \
                    assembler designed for portability and modularity. It \
                    supports a range of object file formats, including Linux \
                    and *BSD a.out, ELF, COFF, Mach−O, 16−bit and 32−bit OBJ \
                    (OMF) format, Win32 and Win64. It will also output plain \
                    binary files, Intel hex and Motorola S−Record formats. Its \
                    syntax is designed to be simple and easy to understand, \
                    similar to the syntax in the Intel Software Developer \
                    Manual with minimal complexity. It supports all currently \
                    known x86 architectural extensions, and has strong support \
                    for macros. NASM also comes with a set of utilities for \
                    handling the RDOFF custom object−file format.

# Compilation (of the final non-bootstrap GHC, which uses the C compiler
# configured in this port) fails with older versions of clang. clang-4.1 from
# Xcode 4.5 is too old, clang-5.1 from from Xcode 5.1 works. I do not have
# any data points in between, so I'm blacklisting everything lower than 5.1.
# If you want to test the versions in between, be my guest.
# Also avoid LLVM GCC 4.2 and GCC 4.2, which are before MacPorts' clang 3.4
# in the fallback list on some systems.

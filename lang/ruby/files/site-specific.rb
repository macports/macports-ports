# Default site_ruby install library setting for normal module
# installation. You can force site installation with the following:
#
#    ruby -rsite-specific extconf.rb
# or
#    ruby -rsite-specific install.rb
#
# This is not required for normal user module installation as they will
# default to site_ruby, it is only provided for consistency. Developers
# creating packages/ports should use the vendor-specific option.

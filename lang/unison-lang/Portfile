description         A friendly programming language from the future.

long_description    Unison’s core idea is that code is immutable and \
                    identified by its content. This lets us reimagine many \
                    aspects of how a programming language works. We simplify \
                    codebase management — Unison has no builds, no dependency \
                    conflicts, and renaming things is trivial. The same core \
                    idea forms the basis for a runtime that robustly supports \
                    dynamic code deployment, allowing a single Unison program \
                    to describe entire elastic distributed systems.

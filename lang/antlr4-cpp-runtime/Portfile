description         ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a \
                    powerful parser generator for reading, processing, \

                    files.

long_description    ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a \
                    powerful parser generator for reading, processing, \
                    executing, or translating structured text or binary \
                    files.  It's widely used to build languages, tools, \
                    and frameworks.  From a grammar, ANTLR generates a \
                    parser that can build parse trees and also generates \
                    a listener interface (or visitor) that makes it easy \
                    to respond to the recognition of phrases of interest.

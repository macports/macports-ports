PortGroup           github 1.0

# This port is for the stable version of ragel, currently 6.x. It had
# previously been updated to the development version, 7.x, but it is
# either buggy and/or not fully backward-compatible with 6.x which has
# caused problems for some ports that depend on ragel, so that version
# is now available in the separate ragel-devel port. Before considering
# updating this port to 7.x whenever it becomes stable, confirm that
# previously-reported problems with 7.x are fixed with the new version.

# Please keep the ragel and ragel-devel ports as similar as possible.

description         Ragel is a state machine compiler.

long_description    Ragel compiles executable finite state machines from \
                    regular languages. Ragel targets C, C++ and ASM. Ragel \
                    state machines can not only recognize byte sequences \
                    as regular expression machines do, but can also execute \
                    code at arbitrary points in the recognition of a regular \
                    language.

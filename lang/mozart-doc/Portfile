description            Mozart-Oz documentation
long_description     The Mozart system is a development platform focused on open \
			distributed computing and constraint-based inferrence.  \
			The system provides excellent support for logic and \
			constraint programming, making it an excellent choice \
			for implementing multi-agent systems.  The language has \
			recently been popularized by the book "Concepts, \
			Techniques, and Models of Computer Progamming." \
			This port installs the documentation and help files.

description         Logtalk - Open source object-oriented logic programming language

long_description    Logtalk is an object-oriented logic programming language that extends and \
                    leverages the Prolog language with a feature set suitable for programming \
                    in the large. Logtalk supports modern code encapsulation and code reuse   \
                    mechanisms without compromising the declarative programming features of   \
                    Prolog. Logtalk is implemented in highly portable code and can use most   \
                    modern and standards compliant Prolog implementations as a back-end       \
                    compiler. As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for modules,  \
                    prototypes, classes, protocols (interfaces), categories (components and   \
                    hot patching), event-driven programming, and high-level multi-threading   \
                    programming. Its distribution uses a commercial friendly license and      \
                    includes full documentation, portable libraries, a comprehensive set of   \
                    portable developer tools, and a large number of programming examples to   \
                    help get you started.

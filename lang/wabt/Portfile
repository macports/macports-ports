description         The WebAssembly Binary Toolkit
long_description    \
    WABT (we pronounce it \"wabbit\") is a suite of tools for WebAssembly, including: \
 \
      wat2wasm: translate from WebAssembly text format to the WebAssembly binary format \
      wasm2wat: the inverse of wat2wasm, translate from the binary format back to the text format (also known as a .wat) \
      wasm-objdump: print information about a wasm binary. Similiar to objdump. \
      wasm-interp: decode and run a WebAssembly binary file using a stack-based interpreter \
      wasm-decompile: decompile a wasm binary into readable C-like syntax. \
      wat-desugar: parse .wat text form as supported by the spec interpreter (s-expressions, flat syntax, or mixed) and print \"canonical\" flat format \
      wasm2c: convert a WebAssembly binary file to a C source and header \
      wasm-strip: remove sections of a WebAssembly binary file \
      wasm-validate: validate a file in the WebAssembly binary format \
      wast2json: convert a file in the wasm spec test format to a JSON file and associated wasm binary files \
      wasm-stats: output stats for a module \
      spectest-interp: read a Spectest JSON file, and run its tests in the interpreter \
 \
    These tools are intended for use in (or for development of) toolchains \
    or other systems that want to manipulate WebAssembly files.

long_description \
    Io is small prototype-based programming language. The ideas in Io are   \
    mostly inspired by Smalltalk (all values are objects), Self,            \
    NewtonScript and Act1 (prototype-based differential inheritance, actors \
    and futures for concurrency), LISP (code is a runtime inspectable /     \
    modifiable tree) and Lua (small, embeddable).

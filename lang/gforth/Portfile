description         fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language
long_description \
    Gforth is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth \
    language. It works nicely with the Emacs editor, offers some \
    nice features such as input completion and history and a \
    powerful locals facility, and it even has (the beginnings of) \
    a manual. Gforth employs traditional implementation \
    techniques: its inner interpreter is indirect or direct threaded.

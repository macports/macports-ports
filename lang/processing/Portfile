long_description    \
    Processing is an open source programming language and environment for people \
    who want to create images, animations, and interactions. Initially developed \
    to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach fundamentals of computer \
    programming within a visual context, Processing also has evolved into a \
    tool for generating finished professional work. Today, there are tens of \
    thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who \
    use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production.

long_description \
                    newLISP is a LISP-like scripting language for doing things you \
                    typically do with scripting languages: programming for the \
                    internet, system administration, text processing, gluing other \
                    programs together, etc. newLISP is a scripting LISP for people \
                    who are fascinated by LISP's beauty and power of expression, but \
                    who need it stripped down to easy-to-learn essentials.

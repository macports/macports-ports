description     Groovy -- a Java-based scripting language

long_description Groovy... \
                * is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine \
                * builds upon the strengths of Java but has additional power \
                  features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk \
                * makes modern programming features available to Java developers \
                  with almost-zero learning curve \
                * provides the ability to statically type check and statically \
                  compile your code for robustness and performance \
                * supports Domain-Specific Languages and other compact syntax so \
                  your code becomes easy to read and maintain \
                * makes writing shell and build scripts easy with its powerful \
                  processing primitives, OO abilities and an Ant DSL \
                * increases developer productivity by reducing scaffolding code \
                  when developing web, GUI, database or console applications \
                * simplifies testing by supporting unit testing and mocking \
                  out-of-the-box \
                * seamlessly integrates with all existing Java classes and \
                  libraries \
                * compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere \
                  you can use Java

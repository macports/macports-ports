description         Caml Preprocessor and Pretty-Printer
long_description    \
    Camlp4 is a software system for writing extensible parsers for programming \
    languages. It provides a set of OCaml libraries that are used to define \
    grammars as well as loadable syntax extensions of such grammars. Camlp4 \
    stands for Caml Preprocessor and Pretty-Printer and one of its most \
    important applications is the definition of domain-specific extensions of \
    the syntax of OCaml. \
    Camlp4 was part of the official OCaml distribution until its version \
    4.01.0. Since then it has been replaced by a simpler system which is \
    easier to maintain and to learn: ppx rewriters and extension points.

description             libc++abi is a new implementation of low level support for a C++ runtime.
long_description        ${description} \
                        Because objects cannot be passed between different versions of the C++ runtime, this port must \
                        replace the host version in order to be used.  On Snow Leopard and earlier, this is done \
                        automatically because there is no existing host version of this library.  On Lion and later, \
                        users must build the port with +replacemnt_libcxx and install the root manually if they wish \
                        to replace the existing host implementation.

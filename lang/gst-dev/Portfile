description	Free implementation of Smalltalk-80
long_description \
		GNU Smalltalk is a free implementation of the Smalltalk-80 language \
		which runs on most versions on Unix and, in general, everywhere you \
		can find a POSIX-compliance library. An uncommon feature of it is \
		that it is well-versed to scripting tasks and headless processing.

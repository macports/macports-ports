description             Blassic is a classic Basic interpreter

long_description        Blassic is a classic Basic interpreter. The line \
                        numbers are mandatory, and it has PEEK & POKE. The \
                        main goal is to execute programs written in old \
                        interpreters, even those that use peculiar control \
                        flow constructs or automodifiable code. However, it \
                        can be used as a scripting language, and has some \
                        not-so-classic instructions. It has graphics modes \
                        that are compatible with some classic systems and \
                        user defined.

description             C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ compiler
long_description        Clang is an "LLVM native" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, \
                        which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles (e.g. \
                        about 3x faster than GCC when compiling Objective-C \
                        code in a debug configuration), extremely useful error \
                        and warning messages and to provide a platform for \
                        building great source level tools. The included Clang \
                        Static Analyzer is a tool automatically finds bugs in \
                        your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool \
                        that can be built using the Clang frontend as a \
                        library to parse C/C++ code.

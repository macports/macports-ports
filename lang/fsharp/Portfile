description             F# is a typed functional programming language.
long_description        F# is a typed functional programming language \
                        for the .NET Framework. It combines the succinctness, \
                        expressivity, and compositionality of typed functional \
                        programming with the runtime support, libraries, \
                        interoperability, tools and object model of .NET. \
                        F# stems from the ML family of languages and has a \
                        core language compatible with that of OCaml, though \
                        also draws from C# and Haskell.

notes "
Warning: ${subport} downloads files during the build phase.
This is contrary to standard MacPorts practices, but it seems to be a fundamental part of msbuild.

description        Medusa is a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer
long_description   Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, \
		   modular, login brute-forcer. The goal is to support as \
		   many services which allow remote authentication as possible. \
		   The author considers following items as some of the key \
		   features of this application. Thread-based parallel testing: \
		   Brute-force testing can be performed against multiple hosts, \
		   users or passwords concurrently. Flexible user input: Target \
		   information (host/user/password) can be specified in a variety \
		   of ways. For example, each item can be either a single entry \
		   or a file containing multiple entries. Additionally, a \
		   combination file format allows the user to refine their target \
		   listing. Modular design: Each service module exists as an \
		   independent .mod file. This means that no modifications are \
		   necessary to the core application in order to extend the \
		   supported list of services for brute-forcing.

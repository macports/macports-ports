description       Prelude Network Intrusion Detection System framework library for access to Prelude NIDS database

long_description  The PreludeDB Library provides an abstraction layer upon the type and \
		  format of the database used to store IDMEF alerts.  It allows developers \
		  to use the Prelude IDMEF database easily and efficiently without worrying \
		  about SQL, and to access the database independently of the type/format \
		  of the database.\
		  \
		  Prelude is an Hybrid IDS framework that relies on the IDMEF (Intrusion \
                  Detection Message Exchange Format) IETF standard.  It enables security \
                  sensors such as Snort, honeyd, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Samhain, \
                  over 30 types of system logs, and many others to verify an attack \
                  by performing automatic correlation between events.

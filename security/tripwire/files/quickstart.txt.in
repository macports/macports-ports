Tripwire for MacPorts Quick Start Guide

Introduction
------------

Tripwire software ensures the integrity of critical system files
and directories by identifying all changes made to specified system
files and directories. Configure Tripwire software to monitor your
system in the way that is best for you. 

Tripwire software works by comparing files and directories against a
baseline. It generates the baseline by taking a "snapshot" of specified
files and directories in a known secure state. Tripwire software then
compares the current system against the baseline and reports any
modifications, additions, or deletions. Use Tripwire software for system
security, intrusion detection, damage assessment, and recovery
forensics.

Post-Installation Instructions
------------------------------

We recommend you read the Release Notes and README file.

The Tripwire port in MacPorts installs the basic program files needed
to run the software. However, this installation does not complete custom
configurations that Tripwire needs to perform correctly. After you
install the Tripwire port, you must:

1. Run the configuration script:

	sudo @SYSCONFDIR@/twsetup.sh

to setup the necessary configuration files. This script walks you
through the processes of setting passphrases and signing the Tripwire
policy and configuration files. 

Note: Once encoded and signed, the configuration and policy files should
not be renamed or moved.

For usage details on the configuration script, run:

	@SYSCONFDIR@/twsetup.sh -h

2. Initialize the Tripwire database file:

	sudo tripwire --init

3. Run the first integrity check:

	sudo tripwire --check

4. Edit the configuration file (twcfg.txt) with a text editor, if desired.
5. Edit the policy file (twpol.txt) with a text editor, if desired.

Note: If you plan to modify the policy file, we recommend you do so
before running the configuration script. If you modify the policy file
after running the configuration script, you must re-run the
configuration script before initializing the database file. 

Modifying the Policy File
-------------------------

You can specify how Tripwire software checks your system in the Tripwire
policy file (twpol.txt). A default policy file is included in the
Tripwire software installation. We recommend you tailor this policy file
to fit your particular system. Tailoring the policy file greatly
increases Tripwire software's ability to ensure the integrity of your
system. 

Locate the default policy file at @SYSCONFDIR@/twpol.txt. An example
policy file (located at @DOCDIR@/policyguide.txt) is included to help
you learn the policy language. Read the sample policy file and the
comments in the sample policy file to learn the policy language. 

After you modify the policy file, follow the Post-Installation
Instructions (run the configuration script). This script signs the
modified policy file and renames it to tw.pol. This is the active policy
file that runs as part of the Tripwire software. 

Selecting Passphrases
---------------------

Tripwire files are signed or encrypted using site or local keys. These
keys are protected by passphrases. When selecting passphrases, the
following recommendations apply:

Use at least eight alphanumeric and symbolic characters for each
passphrase. The maximum length of a passphrase is 1023 characters.
Quotes should not be used as passphrase characters.

Assign a unique passphrase for the site key. The site key passphrase
protects the site key, which is used to sign Tripwire software
configuration and policy files. Assign a unique passphrase for the local
key. The local key signs Tripwire database files. The local key may sign
the Tripwire report files also. 

Store the passphrases in a secure location. There is no way to remove
encryption from a signed file if you forget your passphrase. If you
forget the passphrases, the files are unusable. In that case you must
reinitialize the baseline database.

Initializing the Database
-------------------------

In Database Initialization mode, Tripwire software builds a database of
filesystem objects based on the rules in the policy file. This database
serves as the baseline for integrity checks. The syntax for Database
Initialization mode is:

	sudo tripwire --init 

Running an Integrity Check
--------------------------

The Integrity Check mode compares the current file system objects with
their properties recorded in the Tripwire database. Violations are
printed to stdout. The report file is saved and can later be accessed by
twprint. An email option enables you to send email. The syntax for
Integrity Check mode is:

	sudo tripwire --check 

To cause the Integrity Check to run daily, you can setup a cron job
(using periodic or anacron) to do so.  If you installed the Tripwire
port with the +anacron variant set, an anacron cron.daily script
(tripwire-check) has already been installed for you.  If not, a copy of
this cron script has been installed here:

	@DOCDIR@/tripwire-check

It can be installed manually for use with anacron or periodic as desired
(usually into @PREFIX@/etc/cron.daily or /etc/periodic/daily).

Printing Reports - twprint Print Report Mode
--------------------------------------------

The twprint --print-report mode prints the contents of a Tripwire
report. If you do not specify a report with the --twrfile or -r
command-line argument, the default report file specified by the
configuration file REPORTFILE variable is used. 

Example: On a machine named LIGHTHOUSE, the command would be:

	sudo twprint -m r --twrfile LIGHTHOUSE-19990622-021212.twr

Updating the Database after an Integrity Check
----------------------------------------------

Database Update mode enables you to update the Tripwire database after
an integrity check if you determine that the violations discovered are
valid. This update process saves time by enabling you to update the
database without having to re-initialize it. It also enables selective
updating, which cannot be done through re-initialization. The syntax for
Database Update mode is:

	sudo tripwire --update 

Updating the Policy File
------------------------

Change the way that Tripwire software scans the system by changing the
rules in the policy file. You can  then update the database without a
complete re-initialization. This saves a significant amount of time and
preserves security by keeping the policy file synchronized with the
database it uses.  The syntax for Policy Update mode is:

	sudo tripwire --update-policy 

Testing email functions
-----------------------

Test mode tests the software's email notification system, using the
settings currently specified in the configuration file. The syntax for
Email Test Reporting mode is:

	sudo tripwire --test 

Tripwire Components
-------------------

The policy file begins as a text file containing comments, rules,
directives, and variables. These dictate the way Tripwire software
checks your system. Each rule in the policy file specifies a system
object to be monitored. Rules also describe which changes to the object
to report, and which to ignore. 

System objects are the files and directories you wish to monitor. Each
object is identified by an object name. A property refers to a single
characteristic of an object that Tripwire software can monitor.
Directives control conditional processing of sets of rules in a policy
file. During installation, the text policy file is encrypted and
renamed, and becomes the active policy file. 

The database file is an important component of Tripwire software. When
first installed, Tripwire software uses the policy file rules to create
the database file. The database file is a baseline "snapshot" of the
system in a known secure state. Tripwire software compares this baseline
against the current system to determine what changes have occurred. This
is an integrity check.

When you perform an integrity check, Tripwire software produces report
files. Report files summarize any changes that violated the policy file
rules during the integrity check. You can view the report file in a
variety of formats, at varying levels of detail.  

The Tripwire configuration file stores system-specific information, such
as the location of Tripwire data files. Tripwire software generates some
of the configuration file information during installation. The system
administrator can change parameters in the configuration file at any
time. The configuration file variables POLFILE, DBFILE, REPORTFILE,
SITEKEYFILE, and LOCALKEYFILE specify where the policy file, database
file, report files, and site and local key files reside. These variables
must be defined or the configuration file is invalid. If any of these
variables are undefined, an error occurs on execution of Tripwire
software and the program exits.

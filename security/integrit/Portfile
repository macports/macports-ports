description         integrit is the most simple Tripwire alternative

long_description    integrit is a more simple alternative to file \
                    integrity verification programs like tripwire and \
                    aide. It helps you determine whether an intruder \
                    has modified a computer system. \
                    \
                    integrit works by creating a database that is a \
                    snapshot of the most essential parts of your \
                    computer system. You put the database somewhere \
                    safe, and then later you can use it to make sure \
                    that no one has made any illicit modifications to \
                    the computer system. In the case of a break in, you \
                    know exactly which files have been modified, added, \
                    or removed. \
                    \
                    integrit is a robust, stable piece of software \
                    designed for professional use.

long_description \
	OutGuess is a universal steganographic tool that allows \
	the insertion of hidden information into the redundant \
	bits of data sources. The nature of the data source is \
	irrelevant to the core of OutGuess. The program relies \
	on data specific handlers that will extract redundant \
	bits and write them back after modification. In this \
	version the PNM and JPEG image formats are supported. \
	In the next paragraphs, images will be used as concrete \
	example of data objects, though OutGuess can use any \
	kind of data, as long as a handler is provided.

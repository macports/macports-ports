description         A private certificate authority (X.509 & SSH) & ACME \
                    server for secure automated certificate management, so \
                    you can use TLS everywhere & SSO for SSH.

long_description    step-ca is an online Certificate Authority (CA) for secure, \
                    automated X.509 and SSH certificate management. It's the \
                    server counterpart to step CLI. It is secured with TLS, and \
                    it offers several configurable certificate provisioners, \
                    flexible certificate templating, and pluggable database backends \
                    to suit a wide variety of contexts and workflows. It employs sane \
                    default algorithms and attributes, so you don't have to be a \
                    security engineer to use it securely.

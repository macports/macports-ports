description         ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption toolkit library

long_description    The cpabe toolkit provides a library implementing a \
                    ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption scheme. \
                    \n\nIn a ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption \
                    scheme, each user's private key is associated with a set \
                    of attributes representing their capabilities, and a \
                    ciphertext is encrypted such that only users whose \
                    attributes satisfy a certain policy can decrypt. For \
                    example, we can encrypt a ciphertext such that in a \
                    company it can only be decrypted by a someone with \
                    attributes "Senior" and "Human Resources" or has the \
                    attribute "Executive." One interesting application of \
                    this tool is that we can do Role-Based Access Control \
                    (RBAC) without requiring trusted data storage.

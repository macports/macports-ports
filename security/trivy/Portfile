description         A Simple and Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanner for \
                    Containers, Suitable for CI

long_description    {*}${description}. Trivy detects vulnerabilities of OS \
                    packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and application \
                    dependencies (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.). Trivy \
                    is easy to use. Just install the binary and you're ready \
                    to scan. All you need to do for scanning is to specify a \
                    target such as an image name of the container.

description         An OpenPGP key archiver
long_description    A reasonable way to achieve a long term backup of \
                    OpenPGP keys is to print them out on paper. Paper \
                    and ink have amazingly long retention qualities \
                    - far longer than the magnetic or optical means \
                    that are generally used to back up computer data.

description         Paperkey - an OpenPGP key archiver
long_description    ${description}. A reasonable way to achieve a long term \
                    backup of OpenPGP (GnuPG, PGP, etc) keys is to print \
                    them out on paper. Paper and ink have amazingly long \
                    retention qualities - far longer than the magnetic or \
                    optical means that are generally used to back up \
                    computer data. Paperkey provides an easy way to extract \
                    the necessary data of a private key so it can be \
                    printed and later reimported using the public key for \
                    example on a key server.

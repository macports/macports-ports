description         Cloudflare's PKI and TLS toolkit

long_description    CFSSL is CloudFlare's PKI/TLS swiss army knife. It is \
                    both a command line tool and an HTTP API server for \
                    signing, verifying, and bundling TLS certificates. \
                    CFSSL consists of: a set of packages useful for \
                    building custom TLS PKI tools, the cfssl program - the \
                    canonical command line utility using the CFSSL \
                    packages, the multirootca program - a certificate \
                    authority server that can use multiple signing keys, \
                    the mkbundle program - used to build certificate pool \
                    bundles, the cfssljson program - which takes the JSON \
                    output from the cfssl and multirootca programs and writes \
                    certificates, keys, CSRs, and bundles to disk.

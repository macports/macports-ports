description	  zzuf is a transparent application input fuzzer
long_description  zzuf is a transparent application input fuzzer. Its purpose \
		  is to find bugs in applications by corrupting their \
		  user-contributed data (which more than often comes from \
		  untrusted sources on the Internet). It works by intercepting \
		  file and network operations and changing random bits in the \
		  program's input. zzuf's behaviour is deterministic, making it \
		  easier to reproduce bugs.

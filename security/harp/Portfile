description         Secret management by contract toolchain

long_description    \
    Harp is a tool set to operate secret management by contract. The \
    objective is to reduce the value centric management by handling secret \
    data in a reproducible way by providing a technical stack to describe how \
    your value is managed by contracts and pipelines. Furthermore, we know \
    that naming thing is hard, as a consequence a secret could be \
    consistently associated to a predictable secret identifier used as a key \
    to refer to the secret value. Finally, the secret can hold additional \
    metadata (ownership, rotation period, leak severity, etc.) which can be \
    consumed during the pipeline executions. These key/value associations \
    (path â‡’ value) form a Bundle stored in an immutable file named a \
    Container. This Container acts as a pivot format to allow Harp commands \
    to communicate and create data management pipelines. In addition to that, \
    it provides a template engine used to generate various confidence values \
    (password, passphrase, crypto keys, etc.) and allow more sophisticated \
    rendering operations (configuration files, etc.). Finally, it provides a \
    SDK to allow developers to integrate Harp features in their products, \
    and/or extend the Harp pipeline features by creating new plugins.

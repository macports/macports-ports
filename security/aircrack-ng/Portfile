long_description aircrack is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can recover \
                 keys once enough data packets have been captured. It implements the standard \
		 FMS attack along with some optimizations like KoreK attacks, thus making the \
		 attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools. In fact, aircrack is \
		 a set of tools for auditing wireless networks.

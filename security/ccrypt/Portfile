description             Encrypt and decrypt files and streams

long_description        Utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams. \
                        It was designed to replace the standard unix crypt \
                        utility, which is notorious for using a very weak \
                        encryption algorithm. ccrypt is based on the Rijndael \
                        cipher, which is the U.S. government's chosen candidate \
                        for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, see \
                        http://www.nist.gov/aes/). This cipher is believed to \
                        provide very strong security. Unlike unix crypt, the \
                        algorithm provided by ccrypt is not symmetric, i.e., \
                        one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt. The most \
                        common way to invoke ccrypt is via the commands \
                        ccencrypt and ccdecrypt. There is also a ccat command \
                        for decrypting a file directly to the terminal, thus \
                        reducing the likelihood of leaving temporary plaintext \
                        files around. In addition, there is a compatibility mode \
                        for decrypting legacy unix crypt files.

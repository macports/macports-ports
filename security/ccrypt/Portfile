description		An utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams
long_description	Utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams. It was \
			designed to replace the standard unix crypt utility, which is notorious for \
			using a very weak encryption algorithm. ccrypt is based on the Rijndael \
			cipher, which is the U.S. government's chosen candidate for the Advanced \
			Encryption Standard (AES, see http://www.nist.gov/aes/). This cipher is \
			believed to provide very strong security. \
			Unlike unix crypt, the algorithm provided by ccrypt is not symmetric, i.e., \
			one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt. The most common way to invoke \
			ccrypt is via the commands ccencrypt and ccdecrypt. There is also a ccat \
			command for decrypting a file directly to the terminal, thus reducing the \
			likelihood of leaving temporary plaintext files around. In addition, there \
			is a compatibility mode for decrypting legacy unix crypt files.

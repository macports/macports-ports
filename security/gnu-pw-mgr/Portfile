description         password manager to reconstruct difficult passwords

long_description    ${name} is a password manager designed to make it easy to \
                    reconstruct difficult passwords when they are needed, \
                    while limiting the risk of attack. The user of this \
                    program inputs a very long initial password \"seed\" and a \
                    self-defined transformation of a web site URL to obtain \
                    both the password and a user name hint for that web site. \
                    The seed is stored in a hidden file. However, the \
                    passwords and the URL transforms are never stored \
                    anywhere. You must remember this transform (password id), \
                    or the password is lost forever.

description             A HTTP authentication brute forcer.
long_description        Authforce is an HTTP authentication brute forcer. \
                        Using various methods, it attempts brute force \
                        username and password pairs for a site. It has the \
                        ability to try common username and passwords, username \
                        derivations, and common username/password pairs. It is \
                        used to both test the security of your site and to \
                        prove the insecurity of HTTP authentication based on the \
                        fact that users just don?t pick good passwords.

description         The Pairing-Based Cryptography Library

long_description    ${description}\
                    \n\nPairing-based cryptography is a relatively young area \
                    of cryptography that revolves around a certain function \
                    with special properties. \
                    \n\nThe PBC (Pairing-Based Cryptography) library is a free \
                    C library built on the GMP library that performs the \
                    mathematical operations underlying pairing-based \
                    cryptosystems. \
                    \n\nThe PBC library is designed to be the backbone of \
                    implementations of pairing-based cryptosystems, thus \
                    speed and portability are important goals. It provides \
                    routines such as elliptic curve generation, elliptic \
                    curve arithmetic and pairing computation. Thanks to the \
                    GMP library, despite being written in C, pairings times \
                    are reasonable.

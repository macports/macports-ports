description         A vault for securely storing and accessing AWS \
                    credentials in development environments.

long_description    AWS Vault is a tool to securely store and access AWS \
                    credentials in a development environment.  AWS Vault \
                    stores IAM credentials in your operating system's secure \
                    keystore and then generates temporary credentials from \
                    those to expose to your shell and applications. It's \
                    designed to be complementary to the AWS CLI tools, and \
                    is aware of your profiles and configuration in \
                    ~/.aws/config.

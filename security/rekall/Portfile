description         collection of tools for the extraction of digital \
                    artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples

long_description    The Rekall Framework is a completely open collection \
                    of tools, implemented in Python under the GNU General \
                    Public License, for the extraction of digital artifacts \
                    from volatile memory (RAM) samples. The extraction \
                    techniques are performed completely independent of \
                    the system being investigated but offer visibilty \
                    into the runtime state of the system. The framework \
                    is intended to introduce people to the techniques and \
                    complexities associated with extracting digital \
                    artifacts from volatile memory samples and provide a \
                    platform for further work into this exciting area of research.

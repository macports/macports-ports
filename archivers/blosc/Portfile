description         A blocking, shuffling and loss-less compression library.

long_description    Blosc is a high performance compressor optimized \
                    for binary data. It has been designed to transmit data \
                    to the processor cache faster than the traditional, \
                    non-compressed, direct memory fetch approach via \
                    a memcpy() OS call. It uses the blocking technique \
                    to reduce activity on the memory bus as much as possible.

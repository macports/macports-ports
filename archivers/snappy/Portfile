description         A fast compressor/decompressor

long_description    Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does \
                    not aim for maximum compression, or compatibility with \
                    any other compression library. Instead it aims for very \
                    high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance, \
                    compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order \
                    of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting \
                    compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. \
                    On a single core of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, \
                    Snappy compresses at about 250 MB/sec or more and \
                    decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.

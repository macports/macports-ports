description     An automated system for building LaTeX documents
long_description    This is a building system for LaTeX documents.\
    It is based on a routine that runs just as many compilations as\
    necessary.  The module system provides a great flexibility that\
    virtually allows support for any package with no user intervention,\
    as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. The standard\
    modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, dvipdfm,\
    pdftex, makeindex.  A good number of standard packages are supported,\
    including graphics/graphicx (with automatic conversion between\
    various formats and Metapost compilation).

description		Ruby library and command line utility to deal with POSIX tar archive files.
long_description	Archive::Tar::Minitar is a pure-Ruby library and \
                    command-line utility that provides the ability to \
                    deal with POSIX tar(1) archive files. The \
                    implementation is based heavily on Mauricio \
                    Fernandez's implementation in rpa-base, but has \
                    been reorganised to promote reuse in other projects.

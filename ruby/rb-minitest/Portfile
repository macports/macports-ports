long_description	minitest/unit is a small and fast replacement for \
					ruby's huge and slow test/unit. This is meant to be \
					clean and easy to use both as a regular test writer \
					and for language implementors that need a minimal set of \
					methods to bootstrap a working unit test suite. \
					mini/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. \
					mini/mock, by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock \
					object framework. \
				    (This package was called miniunit once upon a time)

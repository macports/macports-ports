description         Ruby port of Algorithm::Diff using longest common subsequence
long_description    \
    Diff::LCS is a port of Algorithm::Diff that uses the McIlroy-Hunt longest \
    common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to compute intelligent differences \
    between two sequenced enumerable containers. The implementation is based \
    on Mario I. Wolczko's Smalltalk version (1.2, 1993) and Ned Konz's Perl \
    version (Algorithm::Diff).

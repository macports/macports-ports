description		    File type registry for Ruby 'require'
long_description	\
    Polyglot provides a registry of file types that can be loaded by \
    calling its improved version of ‘require’. Each file extension \
    that can be handled by a custom loader is registered by calling \
    Polyglot.register(“ext”, <class>), and then you can simply \
    require “somefile”, which will find and load “somefile.ext” \
    using your custom loader. \
    \
    This supports the creation of DSLs having a syntax that is most \
    appropriate to their purpose, instead of abusing the Ruby syntax.

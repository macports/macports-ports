description         The Database Toolkit for Ruby
long_description    \
    Sequel is a lightweight database access toolkit for Ruby. It provides \
    thread safety, connection pooling and a concise DSL for constructing \
    database queries and table schemas. It also includes a lightweight but \
    comprehensive ORM layer for mapping records to Ruby objects and handling \
    associated records. It supports advanced database features such as prepared \
    statements, bound variables, stored procedures, master/slave \
    configurations, and database sharding. Sequel makes it easy to deal with \
    multiple records without having to break your teeth on SQL.

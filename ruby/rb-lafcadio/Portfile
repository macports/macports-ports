long_description	Lafcadio is an object-relational mapping layer for Ruby and \
                    MySQL. It lets you treat database rows like first-class \
                    Ruby objects, minimizing the amount of time you have to spend \
                    thinking about MySQL vagaries so you can spend more time \
                    thinking about your program's logic.

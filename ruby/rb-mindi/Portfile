description         Minimalist dependency injection
long_description    MinDI is minimalist in that it attempts to map \
                    concepts of DI into basic ruby constructs, rather \
                    than into a layer of specialized constructs. In \
                    particular, classes and modules function as \
                    containers and registries, and methods and method \
                    definitions function as service points and services. \
                    Includes singleton, multiton, threaded, and deferred \
                    services.

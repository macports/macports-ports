description         Haml and Sass: markup languages for HTML and CSS
long_description    \
    Haml is a markup language thatâ€™s used to cleanly and simply describe \
    the HTML of any web document without the use of inline code. Haml \
    functions as a replacement for inline page templating systems such as \
    PHP, ASP, and ERB, the templating language used in most Ruby on Rails \
    applications. However, Haml avoids the need for explicitly coding HTML \
    into the template, because it itself is a description of the HTML, with \
    some code to generate dynamic content. \
    \
    Sass is CSS, plus nested rules, variables, mixins, and more, all in a \
    concise, readable syntax. Haml also contains Sass.

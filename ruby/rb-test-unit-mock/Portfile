description		Mock objects for Test::Unit in Ruby
long_description	Test::Unit::Mock is a class for conveniently \
					building mock objects in Test::Unit test cases. It \
					is based on ideas in Ruby/Mock by Nat Pryce, which \
					is a class for doing much the same thing for RUnit \
					test cases. It allows you do make a mocked object \
					that will respond to all the methods of the real \
					class (albeit probably not with correct results) \
					with one line of code.

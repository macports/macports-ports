description		Provides a common interface to HMAC functionality.
long_description	This module provides common interface to HMAC \
                    functionality. HMAC is a kind of Message \
                    Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm whose \
                    standard is documented in RFC2104. Namely, \
                    a MAC provides a way to check the integrity of \
                    information transmitted over or stored in an \
                    unreliable medium, based on a secret key.

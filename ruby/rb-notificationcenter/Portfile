description		    A notification center implementation
long_description	This class enables an object to broadcast a \
                    notification that an event occurred to other \
                    objects, without having any knowledge of the \
                    objects that it is broadcasting to. An object posts \
                    a notification (identified by a string and possibly \
                    an associated object) to a NotificationCenter (generally \
                    the default one). The NotificationCenter then takes care \
                    of sending the notification to all of the objects \
                    that have registered to receive it.

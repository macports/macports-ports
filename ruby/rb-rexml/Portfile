description         XML processor for the language Ruby
long_description    REXML is an XML 1.0 compliant, reasonably fast, \
                    non-validating XML parser that supports multiple \
                    encodings. It has an API that is designed to be \
                    intuitive, straightforward, and terse. REXML \
                    includes a tree model parser, a SAX2 streaming \
                    parser, and a pull parser. It also includes a full \
                    XPath implementation. All of REXML's parsers pass \
                    100% of the Oasis XML non-validating tests.

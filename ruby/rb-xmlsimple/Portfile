long_description	Class XmlSimple offers an easy API to read and \
					write XML. It is a Ruby translation of Grant \
					McLean's Perl module XML::Simple. Please note, that \
					this tutorial was originally written by Grant \
					McLean. I have only converted it to HTML and \
					adjusted it for the Ruby version.

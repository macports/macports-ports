description         an ActiveRecord inspired way of accessing LDAP
long_description    Ruby/ActiveLDAP provides an object oriented interface to LDAP. \
                    This library was inspired by ActiveRecord (both the concept and the \
                    library). It maps LDAP entries to Ruby objects with LDAP attribute \
                    accessors exposed as methods dynamically assigned based on your LDAP \
                    schema and each object's objectClasses.

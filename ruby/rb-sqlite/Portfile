description		Interface to the SQLite DB engine from Ruby
long_description	Provides an interface for the SQLite DB engine. This \
					differs from the 'ruby-sqlite' project (also on RAA) \
					in that it is more complete, and from the ruby DBI \
					version of SQLite in that it is SQLite specific, so \
					you can do things that would otherwise be more \
					difficult via DBI. If you want portability between \
					backends, use DBI. If you want ease of use with \
					SQLite, use this. \
					Note that this module is NOT compatible with SQLite3.

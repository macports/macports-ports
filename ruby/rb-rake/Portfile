description         Ruby make-like utility using standard Ruby syntax
long_description    This package contains Rake, a simple ruby build \
                    program with capabilities similar to make. \
                    Rake has the following features: \
                    * Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are \
                    completely defined in standard Ruby syntax.  No XML \
                    files to edit.  No quirky Makefile syntax to worry \
                    about (is that a tab or a space?) \
                    * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites. \
                    * Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit \
                    tasks. \
                    * Rake is lightweight.  It can be distributed with \
                    other projects as a single file.  Projects that \
                    depend upon rake do not require that rake be \
                    installed on target systems.

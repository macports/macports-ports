description		Ruby make-like utility using standard Ruby syntax
long_description	This package contains Rake, a simple ruby build \
					program with capabilities similar to make. \
					Rake has the following features: \
					* Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are \
					completely defined in standard Ruby syntax.  No XML \
					files to edit.  No quirky Makefile syntax to worry \
					about (is that a tab or a space?) \
					* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites. \
					* Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit \
					tasks. \
					* Rake is lightweight.  It can be distributed with \
					other projects as a single file.  Projects that \
					depend upon rake do not require that rake be \
					installed on target systems.

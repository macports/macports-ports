description		Pure-ruby implementation of asynchronous multiplexed IO Reactor.
long_description	This module is a pure-Ruby implementation of an asynchronous \
                    multiplexed IO Reactor which is based on the Reactor design \
                    pattern found in Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture, Volume \
                    2: Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects. It allows \
                    a single thread to demultiplex and dispatch events from one or \
                    more IO objects to the appropriate handler.

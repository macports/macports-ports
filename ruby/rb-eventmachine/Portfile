description		    fast, simple event-processing library for Ruby programs
long_description	\
    EventMachine implements a fast, single-threaded engine for arbitrary \
    network communications. It's extremely easy to use in Ruby. EventMachine \
    wraps all interactions with IP sockets, allowing programs to concentrate \
    on the implementation of network protocols. It can be used to create both \
    network servers and clients. To create a server or client, a Ruby program \
    only needs to specify the IP address and port, and provide a Module that \
    implements the communications protocol. Implementations of several \
    standard network protocols are provided with the package, primarily \
    to serve as examples. The real goal of EventMachine is to enable programs \
    to easily interface with other programs using TCP/IP, especially if custom \
    protocols are required.

description		    Ruby library and utility for POSIX tar(1) archive files
long_description	\
    Archive::Tar::Minitar is a pure-Ruby library and command-line utility \
    that provides the ability to deal with POSIX tar(1) archive files. The \
    implementation is based heavily on Mauricio Fern√°ndez's implementation \
    in rpa-base, but has been reorganised to promote reuse in other projects.

description			A toolkit to create and control daemons in different ways
long_description	Daemons provides an easy way to wrap existing ruby \
					scripts  (for example a self-written server)  to be run \
					as a daemon and to be controlled by simple \
					start/stop/restart commands.  You can also call blocks \
					as daemons and control them from the parent or just \
					daemonize the current process.  Besides this basic \
					functionality, daemons offers many advanced features like \
					exception  backtracing and logging (in case your ruby \
					script crashes) and monitoring and automatic restarting \
					of your processes if they crash.

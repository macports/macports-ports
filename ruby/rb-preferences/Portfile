description         Persistent preferences for applications

long_description    The Preferences class is an easy way to make variables \
                    in an application persist in a file. The file is human \
                    readable, through the magic of YAML. Preferences vary \
                    from user to user, so typically the file used for \
                    persistence will be chosen based on the users \
                    environment as well as the name of the app. Any pair \
                    of methods that look like a reader/writer pair can be \
                    persisted, so existing variables can be stored with \
                    little additional fuss and bother.

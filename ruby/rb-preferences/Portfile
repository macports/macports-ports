description         Persistent preferences for applications
long_description    The Preferences class is an easy way to make variables in an application \
                    persist in a file. The file is human readable, through the magic of YAML. \
                    Preferences vary from user to user, so typically the file used for persistence \
                    will be chosen based on the users environment as well as the name of the app. \
                    Any pair of methods that look like a reader/writer pair can be persisted, so \
                    existing variables can be stored with little additional fuss and bother.

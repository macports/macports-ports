long_description    \
    Allow keyword access to array instances.  arrayfields works by adding \
    only a few methods to arrays, namely #fields= and fields, but the \
    #fields= method is hooked to extend an array on a per object basis. \
    In other words, only those arrays whose fields are set will have \
    auto-magical keyword access bestowed on them - all other arrays remain \
    unaffected. Arrays with keyword access require much less memory when \
    compared to hashes/objects and yet still provide fast lookup and preserve \
    data order.

description         The Multiton Design Pattern
long_description    The multiton pattern is similar to a singleton, but instead of only one \
                    instance, there are several similar instances. it's usefull when you want to \
                    avoid constructing objects many times because of some huge expence (connecting \
                    to a database for example), require a set of similar but not identical \
                    objects, and cannot easily control how many time a contructor may be called.

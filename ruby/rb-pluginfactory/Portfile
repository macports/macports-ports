description		    Mixin for making dynamically-loadable plugin classes
long_description	This module contains the PluginFactory mixin. Including \
                    PluginFactory in your class turns it into a \
                    factory for its derivatives, capable of searching for \
                    and loading them by name. This is useful when \
                    you have an abstract base class which defines an \
                    interface and basic functionality for a part of a \
                    larger system, and a collection of subclasses which \
                    implement the interface for different underlying \
                    functionality.

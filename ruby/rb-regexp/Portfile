description		regular expression engine
long_description	Here is an Regexp engine written entirely in Ruby. \
					It allows you to search in text with advanced search \
					patterns.  It supports Perl5 syntax... plus some \
					perl6 syntax (more to come in the future). Its \
					fairly compatible with Ruby's native regexp engine \
					(GNU), and when running against the Rubicon \
					testsuite, it passes 96.025% out of 1560 total \
					tests. \
					The implementation is simple, yet without any \
					optimizations.  Therefore speed is slow.. At some \
					point when optimizations are in place, I plan to do \
					a re-implementation in C++.  Because of the \
					simplicity, the code should be easy to grasp and \
					extend with your own custom code.

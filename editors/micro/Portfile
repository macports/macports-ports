description         A modern and intuitive terminal-based text editor

long_description    micro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be \
                    easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of \
                    the capabilities of modern terminals. As its name \
                    indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to \
                    the nano editor by being easy to install and use. Micro \
                    supports a full-blown plugin system. Plugins are written \
                    in Lua and there is a plugin manager to automatically \
                    download and install your plugins for you.

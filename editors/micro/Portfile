description         A modern and intuitive terminal-based text editor

long_description    \
    micro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and \
    intuitive, while also taking advantage of the capabilities of modern \
    terminals. As its name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a \
    successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use. Micro \
    supports a full-blown plugin system. Plugins are written in Lua and there \
    is a plugin manager to automatically download and install your plugins \
    for you.

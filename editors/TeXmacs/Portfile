description	GNU TeXmacs: A Scientific Text Editor
long_description	\
		GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor,		\
		which was both inspired by TeX and GNU Emacs.		\
		The editor allows you to write structured documents	\
		via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and	\
		user friendly interface. New styles may be created by	\
		the user. The program implements high-quality		\
		typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which help you	\
		to produce professionally looking documents.		\
									\
		The high typesetting quality still goes through for	\
		automatically generated formulas, which makes TeXmacs	\
		suitable as an interface for computer algebra systems.	\
		TeXmacs also supports the Guile/Scheme extension	\
		language, so that you may customize the interface and	\
		write your own extensions to the editor. 

#user_notes	If texmacs can't find guile's modules, you will have to \
#		set GUILE_LOAD_PATH explicitly (usually			\
#		/opt/local/share/guile/1.6).				\
#									\
#		Also, don't forget to set DISPLAY to localhost:0.0 if	\
#		launching TeXmacs from a non-X11 terminal.

#bugs		Some of the computer algebra system sessions (e.g.,	\
#		maxima) will hang if you try to use the online help	\
#		function. A known issue that is being worked on.

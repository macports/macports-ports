long_description \
    Yudit is a unicode text editor for the X Window System. It can do \
    TrueType font rendering, printing, transliterated keyboard input \
    and handwriting recognition with no dependencies on external \
    engines. Its conversion utilities can convert text between various \
    encodings. Keyboard input maps can also act like text converters. \
    There is no need for a pre-installed multi-lingual environment. \
    Menus are translated into many languages.

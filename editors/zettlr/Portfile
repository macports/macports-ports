description         A Markdown Editor for the 21st century.

long_description    \
    Zettlr is a Markdown Editor for the 21st century.  Zettlr supercharges \
    your writing experience and makes no compromises.  It supports standard \
    Markdown and does not need any special handling.  Just pull in your \
    existing notes, Zettelkasten, and paper projects and start working \
    on them immediately.  Zettlr uses a WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You \
    Mean) approach and renders certain elements such as links directly for \
    your convenience.  Zettlr is the first Markdown editor directly aimed at \
    writing professionally. Whether you are a college student, a researcher, \
    a journalist or an author -- Zettlr has the right tools for you.

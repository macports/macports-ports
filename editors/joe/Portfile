description	Joe's Own Editor
long_description	JOE is the professional freeware ASCII text screen editor for UNIX. \
			It makes full use of the power and versatility of UNIX, but lacks the steep \
			learning curve and basic nonsense you have to deal with in every other UNIX \
			editor. JOE has the feel of most IBM PC text editors: The key-sequences are \
			reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo-C.  JOE is much more powerful than those \
			editors, however.  JOE has all of the features a UNIX user should expect: \
			full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update optimizations (JOE is \
			fully useable at 2400 baud), simple installation, and all of the \
			UNIX-integration features of VI.

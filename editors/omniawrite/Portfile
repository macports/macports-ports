                    writing.

long_description    OmniaWrite is a next-generation plain text editor \
                    engineered for creative writing. It is perfect for \
                    writing novels, lyrics, poems, essays, drafts and \
                    screenplays. Writing a good story is one of the most \
                    challenging things in life. But for many it is a dream \
                    worth pursuing. OmniaWrite doesn't help you create a \
                    novel out of nothing, but is a faithful companion at \
                    every step of your projects. Organisation, environment \
                    for concentrated work, export to all common file formats \
                    and much more.

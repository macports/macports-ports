description      An emacs major mode for editing yaml files.
long_description This is a major mode for editing files in the YAML \
                 data serialization format. It was initially developed \
                 by Yoshiki Kurihara and many features were added by \
                 Marshall Vandegrift. As YAML and Python share the fact \
                 that indentation determines structure, this mode \
                 provides indentation and indentation command behavior \
                 very similar to that of python-mode.

notes "
To use this mode, put the following in your ~/.emacs:

(require 'yaml-mode)

To automatically handle files ending in '.yaml, add something like:

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.yaml$\" . yaml-mode))
"

description         Modal editor — Faster as in fewer keystrokes — \
                    Multiple selections — Orthogonal design

long_description    Kakoune is a code editor that implements Vi’s \
                    \"keystrokes as a text editing language\" model. As it’s \
                    also a modal editor, it is somewhat similar to the Vim \
                    editor (after which Kakoune was originally inspired). \
                    Kakoune can operate in two modes, normal and insertion. \
                    In insertion mode, keys are directly inserted into the \
                    current buffer. In normal mode, keys are used to \
                    manipulate the current selection and to enter insertion \
                    mode.  Kakoune has a strong focus on interactivity, most \
                    commands provide immediate and incremental results, while \
                    still being competitive (as in keystroke count) with Vim. \
                    Kakoune works on selections, which are oriented, \
                    inclusive ranges of characters. Selections have an anchor \
                    and a cursor. Most commands move both of them except when \
                    extending selections, where the anchor character stays \
                    fixed and the cursor moves around.

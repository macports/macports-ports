description         \
    Tilde is a text editor for the console/terminal, which provides an \
    intuitive interface for people accustomed to GUI environments such as \
    Gnome, KDE and Windows.

long_description    \
    {*}${description} For example, the short-cut to copy the current \
    selection is Control-C, and to paste the previously copied text the \
    short-cut Control-V can be used. As another example, the File menu can \
    be accessed by pressing Meta-F. However, being a terminal-based program \
    there are limitations. Not all terminals provide sufficient information \
    to the client programs to make Tilde behave in the most intuitive way. \
    When this is the case, Tilde provides work-arounds which should be easy \
    to work with. The main audience for Tilde is users who normally work in \
    GUI environments, but sometimes require an editor for a console/terminal \
    environment. This may be because the computer in question is a server \
    which does not provide a GUI, or is accessed remotely over SSH. Tilde \
    allows these users to edit files without having to learn a completely new \
    interface, such as vi or Emacs do. A result of this choice is that Tilde \
    will not provide all the fancy features that Vim or Emacs provide, but \
    only the most used features.

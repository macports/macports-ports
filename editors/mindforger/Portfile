description             Thinking notebook and Markdown editor

long_description        MindForger is an open, free, well-performing Markdown \
                        editor which respects your privacy and enables \
                        security.  It is actually more than an editor or IDE \
                        - it's a human mind -inspired personal knowledge \
                        management tool.

# mindforger is a Qt5 project, but one of its dependencies, cmark-gfm, uses
# CMake.  The qmake5/qt5 portgroups do not mix very well with the cmake
# portgroup, so we use only cmake-1.1 and specify Qt5 dependencies directly:

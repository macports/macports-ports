description       dfu-programmer is a Device Firmware Update based USB programmer for Atmel chips with a USB bootloader.
long_description  dfu-programmer is an implementation of the Device Firmware Upgrade class \
                  USB driver that enables firmware upgrades for various USB enabled (with the \
                  correct bootloader) Atmel chips.  This program was created because the \
                  Atmel "FLIP" program for flashing devices does not support flashing via USB \
                  on Linux, and because standard DFU loaders do not work for Atmel's chips.

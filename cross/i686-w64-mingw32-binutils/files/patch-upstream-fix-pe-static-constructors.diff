Subject: [PATCH] Import patch from mainline to remove PROVODE qualifiers
 around definitions of __CTOR_LIST__ and __DTOR_LIST__ in PE linker scripts.

	PR 22762
	* scripttempl/pe.sc: Remove PROVIDE()s from __CTOR_LIST__ and
	__DTOR_LIST__ symbols.  Add a comment explaining why this is
	necessary.
	* scripttemp/pep.sc: Likewise.
	* ld.texinfo (PROVIDE): Add a note about the effect of common
	symbols.

 If the program references @samp{etext} but does not define it, the

+Note - the @code{PROVIDE} directive considers a common symbol to be
+defined, even though such a symbol could be combined with the symbol
+that the @code{PROVIDE} would create.  This is particularly important
+when considering constructor and destructor list symbols such as

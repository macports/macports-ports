    Simulating terrible network connections so you can build better systems.

long_description    \
    Testing distributed systems under hard failures like network partitions \
    and instance termination is critical, but it's also important we test \
    them under less catastrophic conditions because this is what they most \
    often experience. Comcast is a tool designed to simulate common network \
    problems like latency, bandwidth restrictions, and \
    dropped/reordered/corrupted packets. It works by wrapping up some system \
    tools in a portable(ish) way.

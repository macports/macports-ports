 .IP "-W normal|byline|single|none"
 Specify an alternate manner for displaying packets, when not in
 hexadecimal mode.  The ``byline'' mode honors embedded linefeeds,
-wrapping text only when a linefeed is encountered.  The ``none'' mode
-doesn't wrap under any circumstance (entire payload is displayed on

-Alter the method by which ngrep displays packet payload.  ``normal''
-mode represents the standard behaviour, ``byline'' instructs ngrep to
-respect embedded linefeeds (useful for observing HTTP transactions,
-for instance), and ``none'' results in the payload on one single line

 .IP "-c cols"
 Ignore the detected terminal width and force the column width to the
 specified size.

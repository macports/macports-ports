description         Library to enable applications to connect to an MQTT broker to publish and receive messages.

long_description    MQTT and MQTT-SN are lightweight publish/subscribe \
                    messaging transports for TCP/IP and connectionless \
                    protocols (such as UDP) respectively. The Eclipse \
                    Paho project provides open source, mainly client side, \
                    implementations of MQTT and MQTT-SN in a variety of \
                    programming languages.

description             A suite of services and tools to make adoption of DNSSEC easier.
long_description        Vantages is a suite of services designed to make the adoption of \
                        DNSSEC easier for administrators of both authoritative name servers \
                        (i.e. zone administrators) and recursive resolvers. Though the suite \
                        comes with a set of useful command line tools (dnsfunnel, dnskey-grab, \
                        etc.), its main functionality is a single daemon (vantaged) that \
                        performs the various tasks needed to smoothly operate either a DNSSEC \
                        zone, or a validating recursive resolver. Vantages' single daemon acts \
                        as a one-stop-shopping solution for the needs of DNSSEC operators. \
                        This is in contrast to other DNSSEC tool suites that require users to \
                        become familiar with numerous daemons and tools and must configure and \
                        run them all separately. With Vantages, operators just install the \
                        daemon and use its web dashboards to configure the services that are needed.

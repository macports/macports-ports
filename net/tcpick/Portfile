description         a tcp stream sniffer, tracker and capturer
long_description \
    tcpick is a textmode sniffer libpcap-based that can track, \
    reassemble and reorder tcp streams. Tcpick is able to save \
    the captured flows in different files or displays them in \
    the terminal, and so it is useful to sniff files that are \
    transmitted via ftp or http. It can display all the stream \
    on the terminal, when the connection is closed in different \
    display modes like hexdump, hexdump + ascii, only printable \
    charachters, raw mode and so on. Available a color mode \
    too, helpful to read and understand better the output of \
    the program. Actually it can handle several interfaces, \
    including ethernet cards and ppp. It is useful to keep \
    track of what users of a network are doing, and is usable \
    with textmode tools like grep, sed, awk.

description         Standard resolver library for communicating with domain name servers

long_description    The libbind functions have been separated from the \
			BIND suite as of BIND 9.6.0. Originally from \
			older versions of BIND, they have been \
			continually maintained and improved but not \
			installed by default with BIND 9. This standard \
			resolver library contains the same historical functions \
			and headers included with many Unix operating systems.

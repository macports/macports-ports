description      A fast and standard-conformant FTP server

long_description "Pure-FTPd is a fast, production-quality, standard-conformant FTP server, \
                 based upon Troll-FTPd. \
                 Unlike other popular FTP servers, it's designed to be secure in default \
                 configuration, has no known buffer overflow, it is really trivial to set \
                 up and it is especially designed for modern kernels. \
                 Features include chroot()ed and/or virtual chroot()ed home directories, \
                 virtual domains, built-in 'ls', anti-warez system, bounded ports for \
                 passive downloads, FXP protocol, bandwidth throttling, ratios, \
                 LDAP / MySQL / PostgreSQL-based authentication, fortune files, Apache-like \
                 log files, fast standalone mode, text / HTML / XML real-time status report, \
                 virtual users, virtual quotas and more."

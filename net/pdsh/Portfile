description         Parallel Distributed Shell

long_description    Pdsh is a high-performance, parallel remote shell utility. It uses a \
                    sliding window of threads to execute remote commands, conserving socket \
                    resources while allowing some connections to timeout if needed. It was \
                    originally written as a replacement for IBM's DSH on clusters at LLNL.

description	Utility for managing network connections
long_description	Netcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across \
			network connections using TCP or UDP protocol.  It is designed to be a \
			reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by \
			other programs and scripts.  At the same time it is a feature-rich \
			network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any \
			kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in \
			capabilities.

## The problem here is that nc110.tgz (at least) doesn't have a
## directory in the tarball.  So we need some way to extract things
## into a named directory rather than just into the work/ directory.

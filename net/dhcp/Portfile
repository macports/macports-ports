long_description    \
    ISC's Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Distribution reference \
    implementation of all aspects of the DHCP protocol, through a suite of \
    DHCP tools: A DHCP server, client, and relay agent.  These tools all use a \
    modular API which is designed to be sufficently general that can easily be \
    made to work on POSIX- compliant operating systems and also non-POSIX \
    systems like Windows NT and Mac OS.\ The DHCP server, client and relay \
    agent are provided both as reference implementations of the protocol and \
    as working, fully-features sample implementations.\ Both the client and \
    the server provide functionality that, while not strictly required by the \
    protocol, is very useful in practice.  The DHCP server also makes \
    allowance for non-compliant clients which one might still like to support.

notes "The dhcpd .conf and .leases files must be named and located as shown for dhcpd to find them:\n\
    ${prefix}/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf (there is a sample file)\n\
    ${prefix}/var/db/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases (use the touch command to create a blank one)\n"

description      A tcpdump tracefile navigation library
long_description \
    libpcapnav is a libpcap wrapper library that allows navigation to \
    arbitrary locations in a tcpdump trace file between reads. The API \
    is intentionally much like that of the pcap library. You can navigate \
    in trace files both in time and space: you can jump to a packet which \
    is at appr. 2/3 of the trace, or you can jump as closely as possible \
    to a packet with a given timestamp, and then read packets from there. \
    In addition, the API provides convenience functions for manipulating \
    timeval structures

description             Wireless network detector and sniffer
long_description        Kismet is an 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and \
                        intrusion detection system.  Kismet will work with any wireless card which \
                        supports raw monitoring (rfmon) mode, and can sniff 802.11b, 802.11a, \
                        802.11n, and 802.11g traffic (devices and drivers permitting). It can work \
                        with MacBook and MacBook Pro Atheros-based cards with which currently KisMac is unable to.\
                        Kismet identifies networks by passively collecting packets and detecting \
                        standard named networks, detecting (and given time, decloaking) hidden \
                        networks, and inferring the presence of non-beaconing networks via data traffic.

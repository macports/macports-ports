description		Secure anonymous FTP server

long_description	oftpd is designed to be as secure as an anonymous FTP server \
			can possibly be. It runs as non-root for most of the time, and \
			uses the Unix chroot() command to hide most of the systems \
			directories from external users - they cannot chane into them \
			even if the server is totally compromised! It contains it's own \
			directory change code, so that it can run efficiently as a \
			threaded server, and it's own directory listing code (many \
			FTP servers execute the system 'ls' command to list files). \
			It is currently being code-reviewed for buffer overflows, and \
			being load-tested.

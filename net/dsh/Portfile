description     Distributed shell: runs a command through rsh or ssh on a cluster of machines.
long_description \
    Dsh executes a command remotely on several different machines at \
    the same time. A utility to effectively do the equivalent of     \
    \"for a in \$(seq 1 10)\; do rsh \$a command\; done\"            \
    in Bourne shell.

# HACK: There is only one translation of the man pages in the current version.
# If more are added in future, then the Makefile.in patch will no longer work
# since LC_CTYPE would need to be set differently for each translation.
# Alternatively, the files could be converted to UTF-8.

description      A small utility to manipulate (not only) IPv6 addresses.
long_description ipv6calc is a small utility written in programming languate C \
                 to manipulate (not only) IPv6 addresses. Intentions were \
                 convering a given IPv6 address into compressed format, \
                 convering a given IPv6 address into the same format like shown \
                 in /proc/net/if_inet6 and (because it was not difficulty) \
                 migrating the Perl program ip6_int into. Now only one utiltity \
                 is needed to do a lot.

description             network sniffer with a rule-based detection engine

long_description        Passive Asset Detection System (PADS) was designed \
                        to supplement active scanners by combining a network \
                        sniffer with a rule-based detection engine similar \
                        to a network IDS. It will listen to a network and \
                        attempt to provide an up-to-date look at the hosts \
                        and services running on the network. The application \
                        operates invisibly and will never release a packet \
                        into the network.

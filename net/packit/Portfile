long_description \
	Packit (Packet toolkit) is a network auditing tool. Its value \
	is derived from its ability to customize, inject, monitor, and \
	manipulate IP traffic. By allowing you to define (spoof) nearly \
	all TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP, ARP, RARP, and Ethernet header options, \
	Packit can be useful in testing firewalls, intrusion \
	detection/prevention systems, port scanning, simulating network \
	traffic, and general TCP/IP auditing. Packit is also an \
	excellent tool for learning TCP/IP.

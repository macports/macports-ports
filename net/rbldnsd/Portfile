description	 	rbldnsd is a small and fast DNS daemon which \
                    is especially made to serve DNSBL zone

long_description	The daemon can serve both IP-based (ordb.org, dsbl.org etc) \
                    and name-based (rfc-ignorant.org) blocklists. Unlike DJB's \
                    rbldns, it has ability to specify individual values for every \
                    entry, can serve as many zones on a single IP address as you \
                    wish, and, finally, it is a real nameserver: it can reply to \
                    DNS metadata requests. The daemon keeps all zones in memory \
                    for faster operations, but its memory usage is very efficient, \
                    especially for repeated TXT values which are stored only once.

description         HTTPie is a command line HTTP client, a user-friendly cURL replacement.
long_description    HTTPie (pronounced aych-tee-tee-pie) is a command line HTTP \
                    client. Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web \
                    services as human-friendly as possible. It provides a simple \
                    http command that allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests \
                    using a simple and natural syntax, and displays colorized \
                    responses. HTTPie can be used for testing, debugging, and \
                    generally interacting with HTTP servers.

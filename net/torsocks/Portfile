description       A transparent socks proxy for use with tor
long_description  Torsocks is an application for Linux, BSD and \
                  OS X that allows you to use network applications \
                  such as ssh and irssi with Tor. Torsocks allows you \
                  to use most socks-friendly applications in a safe \
                  way with Tor. It ensures that DNS requests are \
                  handled safely and explicitly rejects UDP traffic \
                  from the application you're using.

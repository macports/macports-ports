description         Toxiproxy is a framework for simulating network conditions.

long_description    Toxiproxy is a framework for simulating network conditions. \
    It's made specifically to work in testing, CI and development environments, \
    supporting deterministic tampering with connections, but with support for \
    randomized chaos and customization. Toxiproxy is the tool you need to prove \
    with tests that your application doesn't have single points of failure.

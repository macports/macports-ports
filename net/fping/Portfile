description	A scriptable ping program to check if multiple hosts are up
long_description	fping is different from ping in that you can specify any number of \
	 		hosts on the command line, or specify a file containing the lists \
	 		of hosts to ping. Instead of trying one host until it timeouts or \
	 		replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the next \
	 		host in a round-robin fashion. If a host replies, it is noted and \
	 		removed from the list of hosts to check. If a host does not respond \
	 		within a certain time limit and/or retry limit it will be considered \
	 		unreachable.

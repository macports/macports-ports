description         A scriptable ping program to check if multiple hosts are up

long_description    fping is different from ping in that you can specify \
                    any number of hosts on the command line, or specify \
                    a file containing the lists of hosts to ping. \
                    Instead of trying one host until it timeouts or \
                    replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move \
                    on to the next host in a round-robin fashion. If a \
                    host replies, it is noted and removed from the list \
                    of hosts to check. If a host does not respond within \
                    a certain time limit and/or retry limit it will be \
                    considered unreachable.

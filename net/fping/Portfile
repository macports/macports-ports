description		A scriptable ping program to check if multiple hosts are up
long_description	fping is different from ping in that you can specify \
					any number of hosts on the command line, or specify \
					a file containing the lists of hosts to ping. \
					Instead of trying one host until it timeouts or \
					replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move \
					on to the next host in a round-robin fashion. If a \
					host replies, it is noted and removed from the list \
					of hosts to check. If a host does not respond within \
					a certain time limit and/or retry limit it will be \
					considered unreachable.

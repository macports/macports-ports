description         A C library for creating IP packets
long_description \
    libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application \
    programmer to construct and inject network packets. It provides a \
    portable and simplified interface for low-level network packet \
    shaping, handling and injection. Libnet hides much of the tedium of \
    packet creation from the application programmer such as \
    multiplexing, buffer management, arcane packet header information, \
    byte-ordering, OS-dependent issues, and much more. Libnet features \
    portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link layer, \
    as well as a host of supplementary and complementary functionality. \
    Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly applications can be \
    whipped up with little effort. With a bit more time, more complex \
    programs can be written (Traceroute and ping were easily rewritten \
    using libnet and libpcap).

description	Library to Access SMI MIB Information
long_description    The core of the libsmi distribution is a library \
        that allows management applications to access SMI MIB module \
        definitions. On top of this library, there are tools to check, \
        analyze dump, convert, and compare MIB definitions. Finally, the \
        distribution contains a steadily maintained and revised archive of \
        all IETF and IANA maintained standard MIB and PIB modules. \
        The library is internally divided into two layers. The upper layers \
        represent the API to applications that make use of libsmi. \
        Furthermore, the upper layer holds the MIB information in common \
        internal data structures. The lower layer contains the drivers that \
        implement the access to persistent MIB module repositories. \
        Currently drivers for SMIv1/v2 MIB module files and for SPPI PIB \
        module files exist. A driver for an early draft of SMIng is also \
        present.

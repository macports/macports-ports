description         A port-knocking implementation
long_description    knockd is a port-knock server. It listens to all traffic on \
                    an ethernet (or PPP) interface, looking for special "knock" \
                    sequences of port-hits. A client makes these port-hits by \
                    sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a port on the server. \
                    This port need not be open -- since knockd listens at the \
                    link-layer level, it sees all traffic even if it's destined \
                    for a closed port.  When the server detects a specific \
                    sequence of port-hits, it runs a command defined in its \
                    configuration file.  This can be used to open up holes in a \
                    firewall for quick access.

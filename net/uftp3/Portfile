description         Encrypted UDP based FTP with multicast
long_description    UFTP is an encrypted multicast file transfer \
                    program, designed to securely, reliably, and \
                    efficiently transfer files to multiple receivers \
                    simultaneously. This is useful for distributing \
                    large files to a large number of receivers, and is \
                    especially useful for data distribution over \
                    a satellite link (with two way communication), where \
                    the inherent delay makes any TCP based communication \
                    highly inefficient. The multicast encryption scheme \
                    is based on TLS with extensions to allow multiple \
                    receivers to share a common key. UFTP also has the \
                    capability to communicate over disjoint networks \
                    separated by one or more firewalls (NAT traversal) \
                    and without full end-to-end multicast capability \
                    (multicast tunneling) through the use of a UFTP \
                    proxy server. These proxies also provide scalability \
                    by aggregating responses from a group of receivers.

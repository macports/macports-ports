long_description \
    hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. \
    The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping \
    isn't only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, \
    ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send \
    files between a covered channel, and many other features.

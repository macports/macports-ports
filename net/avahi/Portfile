description	A system which facilitates service discovery on a local network
long_description \
	Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local \
	network. This means that you can plug your laptop or computer into \
	a network and instantly be able to view other people who you can \
	chat with, find printers to print to or find files being shared. \
	This kind of technology is already found in Apple MacOS X (branded \
	Rendezvous, Bonjour and sometimes Zeroconf) and is very convenient. \
	Avahi is mainly based on Lennart Poettering's flexmdns mDNS \
	implementation for Linux which has been discontinued in favour \
	of Avahi.

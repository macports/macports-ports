description	A C library for creating IP packets
long_description	\
	libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application \
	programmer to construct and inject network packets. It provides a \
	portable and simplified interface for low-level network packet \
	shaping, handling and injection. Libnet hides much of the tedium of \
	packet creation from the application programmer such as \
	multiplexing, buffer management, arcane packet header information, \
	byte-ordering, OS-dependent issues, and much more. Libnet features \
	portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link layer, \
	as well as a host of supplementary and complementary functionality. \
	Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly applications can be \
	whipped up with little effort. With a bit more time, more complex \
	programs can be written (Traceroute and ping were easily rewritten \
	using libnet and libpcap).

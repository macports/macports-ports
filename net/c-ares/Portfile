description         C library for asynchronous DNS requests (including name resolves)

long_description    This is c-ares, an asynchronous resolver \
                    library. It is intended for applications which \
                    need to perform DNS queries without blocking, or \
                    need to perform multiple DNS queries in \
                    parallel. The primary examples of such \
                    applications are servers which communicate with \
                    multiple clients and programs with graphical user \
                    interfaces.

"Tracks your eBay listings and items that you have bid on. \
Allows you to track auctions that you do not own and have not bid on. \
Snipe tool allows you to schedule your bid to be placed seconds before  \
the auction ends, avoiding driving the price high early in the auction's life. \
Prioritizes updates according to the time left in an auction."

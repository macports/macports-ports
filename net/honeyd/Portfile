description	a virtual honey net daemon with personality
long_description	\
	Honeyd is a small daemon that creates virtual hosts on a network. \
	The hosts can be configured to run arbitrary services, and their TCP \
	personality can be adapted so that they appear to be running certain \
	versions of operating systems. Honeyd enables a single host to claim \
	multiple addresses - I have tested up to 65536 - on a LAN for \
	network simulation.

description         traceroute and ping in a single tool
long_description    mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' \
                    and 'ping' programs in a single network diagnostic \
                    tool. As mtr starts, it investigates the network \
                    connection between the host mtr runs on and \
                    a user-specified destination host. After it \
                    determines the address of each network hop between \
                    the machines, it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO \
                    requests to each one to determine the quality of \
                    the link to each machine. As it does this, it \
                    prints running statistics about each machine.

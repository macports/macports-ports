description		userland implementation of the CARP
long_description	UCARP allows a pair of hosts to share common virtual \
		IP addresses in order to provide automatic failover. It is a \
		portable userland implementation of the secure and patent-free \
		Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP, OpenBSD's \
		alternative to VRRP). Strong points of the CARP protocol \
		include its very low overhead, cryptographically signed \
		messages, interoperability between different operating \
		systems and no need for any dedicated extra network link \
		between redundant hosts.

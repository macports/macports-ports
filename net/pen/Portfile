description	load balancer for simple tcp based protocols
long_description	pen is a load balancer for simple tcp based protocols \
			such as http or smtp. It allows several servers to \
			appear as one to the outside and automatically detects \
			servers that are down and distributes clients among \
			the available servers. This gives high availability \
			and scalable performance.

description         \
    Consul is a distributed service mesh to connect, secure, and configure \
    services across any runtime platform and public or private cloud.

long_description    \
    Consul is a service mesh solution providing a full featured control plane \
    with service discovery, configuration, and segmentation functionality. \
    Each of these features can be used individually as needed, or they can be \
    used together to build a full service mesh.  Consul requires a data plane \
    and supports both a proxy and native integration model. Consul ships with \
    a simple built-in proxy so that everything works out of the box, but also \
    supports 3rd party proxy integrations such as Envoy.

description         Consul is a distributed service mesh to connect, secure, \
                    and configure services across any runtime platform and \
                    public or private cloud.

long_description    Consul is a service mesh solution providing a full \
                    featured control plane with service discovery, \
                    configuration, and segmentation functionality. Each of \
                    these features can be used individually as needed, or \
                    they can be used together to build a full service mesh. \
                    Consul requires a data plane and supports both a proxy \
                    and native integration model. Consul ships with a simple \
                    built-in proxy so that everything works out of the box, \
                    but also supports 3rd party proxy integrations such as \
                    Envoy.

# License is unclear. Source file headers say AGPL 3 with OpenSSL exception as
# they did in version 2.5 and was confirmed in license.txt but in 2.9 (there
# don't appear to have been any 2.6, 2.7, or 2.8 releases) license.txt was
# deleted and the new LICENSE file says GPL 3. This may be a mistake from when
# the new repository was created.

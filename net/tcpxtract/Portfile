description             tool for extracting files from network traffic based \
                        on file signatures

long_description        ${name} is a ${description}. Extracting files based \
                        on file type headers and footers (sometimes called \
                        \"carving\") is an age old data recovery technique. \
                        Tools like Foremost employ this technique to recover \
                        files from arbitrary data streams. Tcpxtract uses \
                        this technique specifically for the application of \
                        intercepting files transmitted across a network. \
                        Other tools that fill a similar need are driftnet \
                        and EtherPEG. driftnet and EtherPEG are tools for \
                        monitoring and extracting graphic files on a network \
                        and are commonly used by network administrators to \
                        police the Internet activity of their users. The \
                        major limitations of driftnet and EtherPEG are that \
                        they only support three filetypes with no easy way \
                        of adding more. The search technique they use is \
                        also not scalable and does not search across packet \
                        boundaries.

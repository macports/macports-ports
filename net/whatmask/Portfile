description	Easily convert between three common subnet mask notations
long_description   \
		Notations supported: \
		 \
	        Name                  Example \
	        --------------------------------- \
	        CIDR                         /24 \
	        Netmask            255.255.255.0 \
		Wilcard Bits           0.0.0.255 \
		\
		The above notations are all identical. CIDR notation commonly has a "/" in \
		of the number (representing the number of bits). Whatmask can accept \
		notations with or without a slash. This notation is used more and more. \
		A lot of popular routers and software supprt this notation.  \
		\
	 	notation is pretty much the standard old-school way of doing it. It is \
	 	by most systems (Un*x, Win, Mac, etc.).  \
	  	\
		bits are similar to the netmask, but they are the logical not of the. \
		This notation is used by a number of popular routers.

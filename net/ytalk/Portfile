long_description \
	 YTalk is a compatible replacement for the BSD talk(1) \
	 program. The main advantage of YTalk is the ability \
	 to communicate with any arbitrary number of users at \
	 once. It supports both talk protocols (talk and ntalk) \
	 and can communicate with several different talk \
	 daemons at the same time. You may also spawn a command \
	 shell in your talk window and let other users watch. \
	 YTalk supports a basic set of VT100 control codes, \
	 as well as job control (BSD support added in 3.1.3).

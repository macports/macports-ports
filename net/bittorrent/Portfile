description      peer-to-peer tool for distributing files
long_description \
	BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely \
	easy to use - downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks. \
	Whenever more than one person is downloading at once they send \
	pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus relieving the \
	central server's bandwidth burden. Even with many simultaneous \
	downloads, the upload burden on the central server remains \
	quite small, since each new downloader introduces new upload \
	capacity.

long_description	Unbound is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS \
					server software product from NLnet Labs, VeriSign Inc.,\
					Nominet, and Kirei. It is distributed free of charge \
					in open source form under the BSD license.\
					Unbound is designed as a set of modular components \
					that incorporate modern features, such as enhanced \
					security (DNSSEC) validation, Internet Protocol \
					Version 6 (IPv6), and a client resolver library API \
					as an integral part of the architecture.

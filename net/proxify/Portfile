description         \
    Swiss Army knife Proxy tool for HTTP/HTTPS traffic capture, manipulation, \
    and replay on the go.

long_description    \
    Swiss Army Knife Proxy for rapid deployments. Supports multiple \
    operations such as request/response dump, filtering and manipulation via \
    DSL language, upstream HTTP/Socks5 proxy. Additionally a replay utility \
    allows to import the dumped traffic (request/responses with correct \
    domain name) into burp or any other proxy by simply setting the upstream \
    proxy to proxify.

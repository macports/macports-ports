description     portable text-mode ICQ clone	
long_description	mICQ is a very portable text-mode ICQ clone. Originally written by Matthew D. Smith, a great part of mICQ has been rewritten by Ruediger Kuhlmann, in particular the support for the new version 8 of the ICQ protocol that became necessary, the internationalization, the file transfer and some restructuring of the code.

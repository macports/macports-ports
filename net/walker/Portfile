description		matches remote sites to local copy using ftp or scp
long_description	Walker is a Python script that updates entire Web sites. \
				It matches the remote site to your local copy using ftp. Once \
				you set it up, it will upload any files that have changed in \
				size, delete any remote files or directories you have deleted \
				locally, and create any remote dirs you have added locally. \
				The default deletion of files and directories can be \
				overridden on the command line. Walker allows you to update \
				your entire site by going online and then running one command \
				in a terminal. It also includes Scpper.py, which updates a \
				site in a similar manner, using scp.

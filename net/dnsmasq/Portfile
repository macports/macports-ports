description	lightweight DNS forwarder and DHCP server
long_description	Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS \
			forwarder and DHCP server. It is designed to provide \
			DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network. It can \
			serve the names of local machines which are not in the \
			global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS \
			server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated \
			addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured \
			either in each host or in a central configuration \
			file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases \
			and BOOTP for network booting of diskless machines.

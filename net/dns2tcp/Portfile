description      TCP over DNS tunnel
long_description    ${name} is a tool for relaying TCP connections over DNS. \
                    There are no authentication nor encryption mechanisms: DNS \
                    encapsulation must be considered as an insecure and \
                    anonymous transport layer. Resources should be public \
                    external services like ssh, ssltunnel, etc.

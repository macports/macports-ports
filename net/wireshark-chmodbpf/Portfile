description         Enable Wireshark to acces macOS capture devices.
long_description    An access_bpf group will be created and its members \
    allowed access to BPF devices at boot to allow unprivileged packet \
    captures. It is meant to support Wireshark where unprivileged access \
    to macOS packet capture devices is desired.

notes "
  To fully complete your installation and use Wireshark
  to capture from devices (like network interfaces) please run:

    sudo dseditgroup -q -o edit -a \[USER\] -t user ${bpf_group}

  and change \[USER\] to the user that needs access to the devices.
  A reboot should not be required for this to take effect.

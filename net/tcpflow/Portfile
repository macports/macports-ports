description      TCP flow recorder
long_description \
    tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP \
    connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient \
    for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like tcpdump(4) shows \
    a summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the \
    data that's actually being transmitted.  In contrast, tcpflow \
    reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a \
    separate file for later analysis.  tcpflow understands TCP sequence \
    numbers and will correctly reconstruct data streams regardless of \
    retransmissions or out-of-order delivery.

description         Easily and securely send things from one computer to \
                    another

long_description    croc is a tool that allows any two computers to simply \
                    and securely transfer files and folders. AFAIK, croc is \
                    the only CLI file-transfer tool that: allows any two \
                    computers to transfer data (using a relay), provides \
                    end-to-end encryption (using PAKE), enables easy \
                    cross-platform transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac), allows \
                    multiple file transfers, allows resuming transfers that \
                    are interrupted, does not need a local server or \
                    port-forwarding, is faster than wormhole, rsync, scp \
                    through compression and multiplexing (speedups 1.5x to \
                    4x), and supports IPv6.

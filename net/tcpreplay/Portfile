description         Replay pcap files at arbitrary speeds onto the network
long_description    \
    Tcpreplay is a suite of BSD licensed tools written by Aaron Turner for \
    *NIX operating systems which gives you the ability to use previously \
    captured traffic in libpcap format to test a variety of network devices. \
    It allows you to classify traffic as client or server, rewrite Layer 2, 3 \
    and 4 headers and finally replay the traffic back onto the network and \
    through other devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, NIDS and \
    IPS's. Tcpreplay supports both single and dual NIC modes for testing both \
    sniffing and inline devices.

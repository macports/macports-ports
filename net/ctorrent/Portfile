# Original ctorrent development has been stopped but the 'enhanced ctorrent'
# project started to maintain the code.
# The Sourceforge project name of 'enhanced ctorrent' is 'dtorrent', which
# might be confusing. However, the unix name of the software is still
# 'ctorrent', which is why it is this port's name.

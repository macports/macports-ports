description         vpnc-script replacement for split-tunnel setup
long_description    Replacement for the vpnc-script used by OpenConnect or VPNC. \
                    \
                    \n\nInstead of trying to copy the behavior of standard \
                    corporate VPN clients, which normally reroute all \
                    your network traffic through the VPN, this one \
                    tries to minimize your contact with an intrusive \
                    VPN. This is also known as a split-tunnel VPN, \
                    since it splits your traffic between the VPN \
                    tunnel and your normal network interfaces. \
                    \
                    \n\nIf you are using a VPN to route all your traffic \
                    for privacy reasons (or to avoid censorship in \
                    repressive countries), then you do not want to use \
                    this.

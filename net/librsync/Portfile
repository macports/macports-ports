description         library that implements the rsync remote-delta algorithm

long_description    librsync is a free software library that implements \
                    the rsync remote-delta algorithm. This algorithm allows \
                    efficient remote updates of a file, without requiring the \
                    old and new versions to both be present at the sending \
                    end. The library uses a streaming design similar to that \
                    of zlib with the aim of allowing it to be embedded into \
                    many different applications. librsync is not \
                    wire-compatible with rsync 2.x, and is not likely to be \
                    in the future.

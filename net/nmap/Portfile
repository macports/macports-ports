long_description Nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although \
		 it works fine for single hosts. The guiding philosophy for \
		 the creation of nmap was TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way \
		 To Do It). This is the Perl slogan, but it is equally \
		 applicable to scanners. Sometimes you need speed, other \
		 times you may need stealth. In some cases, bypassing \
		 firewalls may be required. Not to mention the fact that you \
		 may want to scan different protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc.). \
		 You just can't do all this with one scanning mode. And you \
		 don't want to have 10 different scanners around, all with \
		 different interfaces and capabilities.

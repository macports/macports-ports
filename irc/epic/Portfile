description	The (E)nhanced (P)rogrammable (I)RC-II (C)lient
long_description	EPIC4 is a new direction in ircII development. No longer is EPIC 100% \
			backwards compatible with ircII, but instead those things where \
			compatibility is undesirable have been found and fixed. No gratuitous \
			incompatibilities have been added, but lots of new code has been added to \
			make EPIC the best ircII client available.

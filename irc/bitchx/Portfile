description         BitchX - An IRC Client based on ircII w/ ANSI color and much much more.
long_description    BitchX is an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client by Colten Edwards aka \
                    panasync@efnet, it is based on it's predecessors ircII and EPIC. \
                    BitchX was originally started as a script by Trench and HappyCrappy \
                    for the popular UNIX IRC client ircII. Around Christmas of 1994 the \
                    script was patched directly into the client by panasync.

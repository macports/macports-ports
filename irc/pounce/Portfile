description         IRC Pouncer

long_description    \
    ${name} is a multi-client, TLS-only IRC bouncer. It maintains a \
    persistent connection to an IRC server, acting as a proxy and buffer for \
    a number of clients. When a client connects, any messages received since \
    it last disconnected will be relayed to it. Unlike some other bouncers, \
    pounce uses a single buffer for all IRC messages, which acts as a queue \
    from which each client reads messages independently. ${name} speaks \
    regular modern IRC to both servers and clients, using the server-time \
    extension to indicate when messages originally occurred. Clients identify \
    themselves to pounce by their IRC usernames.

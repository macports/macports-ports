description	GPL licensed GUI IRC client for Mac OS X
long_description	ShadowIRC is a new MacOS IRC client, written specifically with \
			speed and extensibility in mind.  ShadowIRC is extensible with \
			C-coded plugins, compiled with CodeWarrior. This makes ShadowIRC \
			plugins much faster and much more flexible than Ircle's \
			AppleScript-based scripts.

description         ${name} encodes and decodes arbitrary binary data \
                    in five-letter code groups, just like spies use!

long_description    ${name} encodes any file into five-letter code \
                    groups, allowing it to be transmitted through any \
                    medium, and decodes files containing codegroups \
                    into the original input. Encoded files contain a \
                    16-bit cyclical redundancy check (CRC) and file \
                    size to verify, when decoded, that the message is \
                    complete and correct. Files being decoded may \
                    contain other information before and after the \
                    codegroups, allowing in-the-clear annotations to \
                    be included. \
                    \n \
                    \n${name} makes no attempt, on its own, to prevent \
                    your message from being read. Cryptographic \
                    security should be delegated to a package intended \
                    for that purpose, such as pgp. ${name} can then be \
                    applied to the encrypted binary output, \
                    transforming it into easily transmitted text. Text \
                    created by ${name} uses only upper case ASCII \
                    letters and spaces. Unlike files encoded with \
                    uuencode or pgp's “ASCII armour” facility, the \
                    output of ${name} can be easily (albeit tediously) \
                    read over the telephone, broadcast by shortwave \
                    radio to agents in the field, or sent by telegram, \
                    telex, or Morse code. \
                    \n \
                    \nOnly ${name} conforms to the telegraphic \
                    convention of all upper case letters, and passes \
                    the “telephone test” of being readable without any \
                    modifiers such as “capital” and “lower-case”. \
                    Avoiding punctuation marks and lower case letters \
                    makes the output of ${name} much easier to \
                    transmit over a voice or traditional telegraphic \
                    link.

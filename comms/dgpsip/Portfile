description	Differential GPS over IP communication device
long_description	On a stationary GPS without a differential correction \
			signal, you should see a 20 m average radius "drunken walk" \
			pattern. On the same receiver with DGPS corrections and a \
			good view of the sky, the error the same receiver with DGPS \
			corrections and a good view of the sky, the error should be \
			reduced to approximately 2 m average radius. If you've always \
			wanted to know exactly where your house is located without that \
			annoying GPS "wander," but didn't want to spend the money for \
			a DGPS radio, here is your big chance! I'd like to announce a \
			fun DGPS hack. I've written a small Un*x server and client for \
			redistributing DGPS correction signals over the Net. Basically \
			the server grabs the serial byte stream from my DGPS radio and \
			sends it off over a TCP connection. The client does the same thing \
			but in reverse.  The result is that you can receive the local DGPS \
			corrections from absolutely anywhere by using the Internet as the \
			world's largest extension cord.  You'll still need to be within 1000 \
			miles or so of San Francisco, California, USA for best results. However \
			chances are better error will still be reduced if you are 2000 to 3000 \
			miles away. Several respondents from 2000 miles away have noted that the \
			remote differential signals have diminished the SA-induced position and \
			velocity errors by approximately 3 times.

description         Minimal dumb-terminal emulation program
long_description \
        Picocom was designed to serve as a simple, manual, \
        modem configuration, testing, and debugging tool. \
        It has also served (quite well) as a low-tech \
        "terminal-window" to allow operator intervention in \
        PPP connection scripts (something like the ms-windows \
        "open terminal window before / after dialing" feature). \
        It could also prove useful in many other similar tasks.

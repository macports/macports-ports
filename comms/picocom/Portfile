description	Minimal dumb-terminal emulation program
long_description \
		Picocom was designed to serve as a simple, manual, \
		modem configuration, testing, and debugging tool. \
		It has also served (quite well) as a low-tech \
		"terminal-window" to allow operator intervention in \
		PPP connection scripts (something like the ms-windows \
		"open terminal window before / after dialing" feature). \
		It could also prove useful in many other similar tasks.

description     A library providing routines for paper size management
long_description \
                The paper library and accompanying files are intended \
                to provide a simple way for applications to take \
                actions based on a system- or user-specified paper size.

    # We introduce a subport for files with different licenses.
    # Including them in the 'libpaper' port would prevent the
    # distribution of MacPorts binary archives for some prominent
    # tools like Ghostscript or ImagicMagick.
    description         The executables of the libpaper package
    long_description    Provide the new 'paper' and deprecated 'paperconf' \
                        utility programs that come with the libpaper \
                        library. Both are used to print paper size \
                        information.

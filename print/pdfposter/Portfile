description             scale and tile PDF images/pages to print on multiple pages

long_description        Pdfposter can be used to create a large poster by \
                        building it from multiple pages and/or printing it on \
                        large media. It expects as input a PDF file, normally \
                        printing on a single page. The output is again a PDF \
                        file, maybe containing multiple pages together building \
                        the poster. The input page will be scaled to obtain the \
                        desired size, much like poster does for PostScript \
                        files, but working with PDF, since sometimes poster \
                        does not like your files converted from PDF. :-) \
                        Indeed pdfposter was inspired by poster.

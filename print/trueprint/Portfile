long_description    GNU Trueprint takes C source files and other text files \
                    and prints them on PostScript printers. It is intended to \
                    be used by programmers and includes a wealth of features, \
                    including diff-marking, an indentation count, function \
                    and file indices, and many others that are useful when \
                    printing source code.

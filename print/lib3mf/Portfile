description         \
    lib3mf is an implementation of the 3D Manufacturing Format file standard.
long_description    \
    {*}${description}\nIt provides 3MF reading and writing capabilities, as \
    well as conversion and validation tools for input and output data. lib3mf \
    runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS and offers a clean and easy-to-use API in \
    various programming languages to speed up the development and keep \
    integration costs at a minimum.\nAs 3MF shall become an universal 3D \
    Printing standard, its quick adoption is very important. This library \
    shall lower all barriers of adoption to any possible user, let it be \
    software providers, hardware providers, service providers or middleware \
    tools.

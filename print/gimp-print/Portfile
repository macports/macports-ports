long_description \
    Gimp-Print is a package of high quality printer drivers for Linux, \
    BSD, Solaris, IRIX, and other UNIX-alike operating systems. In many \
    cases, these drivers rival or exceed the OEM drivers in quality and \
    functionality. Our goal is to produce the highest possible output \
    quality from all supported printers. To that end, we have done \
    extensive work on screening algorithms, color generation, and \
    printer feature utilization. We are continuing our work in all of \
    these areas to produce ever higher quality results, particularly on \
    the ubiquitous, inexpensive inkjet printers that are nonetheless \
    capable of nearly photographic output quality.

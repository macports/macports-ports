description		A natural language translation library
long_description	libtranslate is a library for translating text and web \
				pages between natural languages. Its modular infrastructure \
				allows to implement new translation services separately from \
				the core library. libtranslate is shipped with a generic \
				module supporting web-based translation services such as Babel \
				Fish, Google Language Tools and SYSTRAN. Moreover, the generic \
				module allows to add new services simply by adding a few lines \
				to a XML file. The libtranslate distribution includes a \
				powerful command line interface (see translate(1)).

description         FreeBSD Japanese Man Pager.
long_description    manjpfb is pager of FreeBSD Japanese man using Python 3.\
                    The program does not store man-data and download it with each request.\
                    Since it is a Python script, it is expected to run on many operating systems in the future.\
                    We can read the FreeBSD Japanese man on many Operating Systems.\
                    There is man-data that is not fully translated, but this is currently by design.\
                    Please note that I do not take full responsibility for the translation of the documents.

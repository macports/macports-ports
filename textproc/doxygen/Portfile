description             Documentation system for several programming languages
long_description        It can generate an on-line documentation browser \
                        (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual \
                        from a set of documented source files. There is \
                        also support for generating output in RTF \
                        (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, \
                        compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The \
                        documentation is extracted directly from the \
                        sources, which makes it much easier to keep the \
                        documentation consistent with the source code. \
                        You can configure doxygen to extract the code \
                        structure from undocumented source files. This \
                        is very useful to quickly find your way in large \
                        source distributions. You can also visualize the \
                        relations between the various elements by means \
                        of include dependency graphs, inheritance \
                        diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are \
                        all generated automatically.

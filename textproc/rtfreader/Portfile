description             Utility to read Microsoft RTF files

long_description        RTF is the Microsoft Rich Text Format, a more portable, \
                        mostly ASCII formatting language that is exported by \
                        word processors like MS Word.  The files generally have \
                        the extension .rtf, but occasionally have .doc \
                        extensions as well.  This parser is from the Microsoft \
                        spec, ported to Unix systems.

long_description RTF is the Microsoft Rich Text Format, a more portable, \
		 mostly ASCII formatting language that is exported by \
		 word processors like MS Word.  The files generally have \
		 the extension .rtf, but occasionally have .doc \
		 extensions as well.  This parser is from the Microsoft \
		 spec, ported to Unix systems.

description	Display word differences between text files
long_description wdiff compares two files, finding which \
 words have been deleted or added to old_file to get new_file. A \
 word is anything between whitespace. The output is collected and \
 used to produce an annotated copy of new_file on standard output. \
 Suitable annotations produce a nice display of word differences \
 between the original files.

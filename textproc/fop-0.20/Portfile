description         Apache FOP Java XSL-FO Print Formatter, 0.20 branch
long_description \
    FOP is the world's first print formatter driven by XSL formatting \
    objects. It is a Java application that reads a formatting object \
    tree conforming to the XSL-FO Version 1.0 W3C Recommendation and \
    then turns it into a PDF document or allows you to preview it \
    directly on screen.  This release is from the old 0.20 branch.

# Apache recommended that this version of FOP be linked to FOP-specific versions
# of the Java libraries that it depends on (which are distributed with FOP), and
# they do not guarantee that FOP will work with any other versions.  Since this
# version of FOP and the dependencies it uses are now significantly older than
# the latest versions, we might as well only use the binary distribution (unless
# anyone else comes up with a compelling reason to change this).  For the same
# reason, we also stick to the directory structure within the archive, since it
# isolates FOP and its libraries from conflicts with other versions.

long_description    Re-Tail is a command line program which is intended as an \
                    intelligent incremental logfile reader. It will read a file or \
                    group of files given on the command line, and output any changes \
                    since last time it read the file(s) in question. It will attempt \
                    to compensate if the filesize changes unexpectedly, and will also \
                    attempt to compensate if the file contents changes as well. It is \
                    not a very complex program.

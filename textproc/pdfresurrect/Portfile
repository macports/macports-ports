description         tool for analyzing PDF documents

long_description    PDFResurrect is a tool aimed at analyzing PDF documents. \
                    The PDF format allows for previous document changes to be \
                    retained in a more recent version of the document, thereby \
                    creating a running history of changes for the document. \
                    This tool attempts to extract all previous versions while \
                    also producing a summary of changes between versions. This \
                    tool can also “scrub” or write data over the original \
                    instances of PDF objects that have been modified or \
                    deleted, in an effort to disguise information from \
                    previous versions that might not be intended for anyone \
                    else to read.

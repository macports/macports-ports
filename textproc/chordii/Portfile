description         Chordii takes input files containing the lyrics and chords of one or more songs and produces a print (PostScript) version of these songs.
long_description    Chordii, pronounced chord-ee-ee, is a utility that was \
                    first created by lazy guitarists who got tired of turning \
                    pages in the middle of the songs they liked. \
                    \
                    Chordii takes one or more input files containing the \
                    lyrics and chords of one or more songs and produces a \
                    print (PostScript) version of these songs. \
                    \
                    The output has the following characteristics: \
                    * titles and sub-titles have been centered, \
                    * the lyrics appear in the font and size of your choice, \
                    * all chords names appear right above the right lyrics, \
                    * all chords used in a song appear as grids at the bottom of the page. \
                    \
                    Optionally, you can also: \
                    * generate an index of your songs, \
                    * have the pages numbered, \
                    * have chords transposed up or down, \
                    * print in 2-up or 4-up modes (multiple pages per printed sheet) and, \
                    * insert tablature and comments. \
                    \
                    You have a great many options on the final appearance of your songs.

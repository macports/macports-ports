 Documents generally look worse when rescaled. This is especially true of documents that contain bitmaps, be them bitmap fonts or bitmap images. The C<--magic> option suppresses the default rescaling behavior of C<psbind> whenever possible. By "whenever possible" we mean whenever the unscaled originals will fit in the output, without taking C<--margin> or C<--border> into account. This option is particularly useful for documents that C<psbind> would normally decide to I<expand> after trimming off margins.

description       A collection of programs, scripts and data, to check Scripture translations.

long_description  A tool for people making a translation of the Bible. ScriptureChecks \
                  can check a translation for things like the consistency of format markers \
                  and whether all chapters and verses are included.  It handles either \
                  USFM or OSIS formatted text. ScriptureChecks is a utility used by the \
                  Bibledit program, but can also be utilized by other programs.

description       An extension for reading and writing YAML

long_description  Syck is an extension for reading and writing YAML swiftly \
                  in popular scripting languages. As Syck loads the YAML, it \
                  stores the data directly in your language's symbol table. \
                  This means speed. This means power. This means Do not disturb \
                  Syck because it is so focused on the task at hand that it \
                  will slay you mortally if you get in its way.

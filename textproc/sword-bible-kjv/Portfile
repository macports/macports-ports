description		King James Version (1769) with Strongs Numbers and Morphology
long_description	This is the King James Version of the Holy Bible \
					(also known as the Authorized Version) with embedded \
					Strong's Numbers.  The rights to the base text are \
					held by the Crown of England. The Strong's numbers \
					in the OT were obtained from The Bible Foundation: \
					http://www.bf.org. The NT Strong's data was obtained \
					from The KJV2003 Project at CrossWire: \
					http://www.crosswire.org. These mechanisms provide a \
					useful means for looking up the exact original \
					language word in a lexicon that is keyed to Strong's \
					numbers.

description         Apache FOP Java XSL-FO Print Formatter
long_description    Apache FOP is the world's first print formatter driven by \
                    XSL formatting objects. It is a Java application that \
                    reads a formatting object tree conforming to the XSL 1.0 \
                    Recommendation (15 October 2001) and then turns it into a \
                    PDF document, certain other output formats or allows you \
                    to preview it directly on screen. Some parts of the XSL \
                    1.1 specification (work in progress!) have also been \
                    implemented.

# Apache recommends at present that FOP be linked to FOP-specific versions of
# the Java libraries that it depends on (which are distributed with FOP), as
# both it and some of those libraries are undergoing a lot of changes, and they
# do not guarantee that FOP will work with any other versions.  We therefore
# might as well only use the binary distribution, unless anyone else comes up
# with a compelling reason to change this.  For the same reason, we also stick
# to the directory structure within the archive, since it isolates FOP and its
# libraries from conflicts with other versions.

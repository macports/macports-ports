long_description    \
    Typst is a new markup-based typsetting system that is designed to be as \
    powerful as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has \
    built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks, flexible functions \
    for everything else, a tightly integrated scripting system, math \
    typesetting, bibliography management, and more. Typst also has fast \
    compile times thanks to incremental compilatioa, as well as friendly \
    error messages in case something goes wrong.

long_description	Nave's Topics were originaly produced by Orville J. \
					Nave, A.M., D.D., LL.D. while serving as a Chaplin \
					in the United States Army. He referred to this work \
					as "the result of fourteen years of delightful and \
					untiring study of the Word of God." Nave's topics \
					were originally published in the early 1900's, and a \
					photo-offset reproduction is currently published by \
					Hendrickson, ISBN 0-917006-02-X.  The title page \
					states that this work consists of 20,000+ topics and \
					subtopics, and 100,000 references to the Scriptures.

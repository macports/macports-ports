long_description    	Less is a program similar to more, but which allows backward \
			movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does \
			as well as forward movement. Also, less does not have to read the \
			entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts \
			up faster than text editors like vi. Less uses termcap (or terminfo \
			on some systems), so it can run on a variety of terminals. There is \
			even limited support for hardcopy terminals.

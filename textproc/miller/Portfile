long_description    Miller is like awk, sed, cut, join, and sort for \
                    name-indexed data such as CSV, TSV, and tabular JSON. \
                    You get to work with your data using named fields, without \
                    needing to count positional column indices. It operates on \
                    key-value-pair data while the familiar Unix tools operate \
                    on integer-indexed fields: if the natural data structure \
                    for the latter is the array, then Millerâ€™s natural data \
                    structure is the insertion-ordered hash map. This \
                    encompasses a variety of data formats, including but not \
                    limited to the familiar CSV, TSV, and JSON. (Miller can \
                    handle positionally-indexed data as a special case.)

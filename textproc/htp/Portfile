description         an HTML pre-processor
long_description    Htp was intended as a HTML pre-processor. It is able to \
                    preprocess HTML, XHTML, XML and CSS files (htp could \
                    process any text based files). Its purpose is to assist \
                    you to maintain a consistent "look" over an entire set of \
                    web pages. This is done by allowing you to define your own \
                    tags as abbreviations for sets of standard HTML tags.

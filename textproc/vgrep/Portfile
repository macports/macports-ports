description         an easy to use front-end for (git) grep

long_description    vgrep is a command-line tool to search textual patterns \
                    in directories. It serves as a front-end to grep and \
                    git-grep and allows to open the indexed matching lines \
                    in a user-specified editor. vgrep is inspired by the \
                    ancient cgvg scripts but extended to perform further \
                    operations such as listing statistics of files and \
                    directory trees or showing the context lines before and \
                    after the matches.

description         an easy to use front-end for (git) grep

long_description    \
    vgrep is a command-line tool to search textual patterns in directories. \
    It serves as a front-end to grep and git-grep and allows to open the \
    indexed matching lines in a user-specified editor. vgrep is inspired by \
    the ancient cgvg scripts but extended to perform further operations such \
    as listing statistics of files and directory trees or showing the context \
    lines before and after the matches.

description         library for manipulating Unicode strings
long_description    Text files are nowadays usually encoded in Unicode, and may consist of \
                    very different scripts – from Latin letters to Chinese Hanzi –, with many \
                    kinds of special characters – accents, right-to-left writing marks, \
                    hyphens, Roman numbers, and much more. But the POSIX platform APIs for \
                    text do not contain adequate functions for dealing with particular \
                    properties of many Unicode characters. In fact, the POSIX APIs for text \
                    have several assumptions at their base which don't hold for Unicode text. \
                    This library provides functions for manipulating Unicode strings and for \
                    manipulating C strings according to the Unicode standard.

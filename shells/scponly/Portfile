description	login shell for accounts with only scp access
long_description	scponly is an alternative shell (of sorts) for system \
			administrators who would like to provide access to \
			remote users to both read and write local files \
			without providing any remote execution priviledges. \
			Functionally, it is best described as a wrapper to the \
			tried and true ssh suite of applications.

long_description	\
	At the moment, it has most of the ksh88 features, not much of \
	the ksh93 features, and a number of its own features. pdksh was \
	initially created by Eric Gisin using Charles Forsyth's public \
	domain V7 shell as a base as well as parts of the BRL shell. \
	Since then a number of people have maintained and contributed to it

    Bash-like \$SHELL designed for greater commandline productivity and safer \
    shell scripts

long_description    \
    ${name} is a shell, like bash / zsh / fish / etc. It follows a similar \
    syntax to POSIX shells like Bash however supports more advanced features \
    than you'd typically expect from a \$SHELL. It aims to be similar enough \
    to traditional shells that you can retain most of your muscle memory, \
    while not being afraid to make breaking changes where "bash-isms" lead to \
    unreadable, hard to maintain, or unsafe code.  ${name} is designed for \
    DevOps productivity so it isn't suited for high-performance workloads \
    beyond what you'd typically run in Bash (eg pipelines forked as \
    concurrent processes).

description         Bash-like \$SHELL designed for greater commandline \
                    productivity and safer shell scripts

long_description    ${name} is a shell, like bash / zsh / fish / etc. It \
                    follows a similar syntax to POSIX shells like Bash \
                    however supports more advanced features than you'd \
                    typically expect from a \$SHELL. It aims to be similar \
                    enough to traditional shells that you can retain most of \
                    your muscle memory, while not being afraid to make \
                    breaking changes where "bash-isms" lead to unreadable, \
                    hard to maintain, or unsafe code.  ${name} is designed \
                    for DevOps productivity so it isn't suited for \
                    high-performance workloads beyond what you'd typically \
                    run in Bash (eg pipelines forked as concurrent processes).

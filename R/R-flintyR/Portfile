description         Simple and flexible tests of sample exchangeability
long_description    Given a multivariate dataset and some knowledge about the dependencies between its features, \
                    it is customary to fit a statistical model to the features to infer parameters of interest. \
                    Such a procedure implicitly assumes that the sample is exchangeable. This package provides \
                    a flexible non-parametric test of this exchangeability assumption, allowing the user to specify \
                    the feature dependencies by hand as long as features can be grouped into disjoint independent sets. \
                    This package also allows users to test a dual hypothesis, which is, given that the sample is exchangeable, \
                    does a proposed grouping of the features into disjoint sets also produce statistically independent sets of features?

description         Single precision (float) matrices for R
long_description    R comes with a suite of utilities for linear algebra with numeric (double precision) vectors/matrices. \
                    However, sometimes single precision (or less) is more than enough for a particular task. \
                    This package extends R linear algebra facilities to include 32-bit float (single precision) data.

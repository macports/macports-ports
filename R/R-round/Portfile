description         Rounding to decimal digits
long_description    Decimal rounding is non-trivial in binary arithmetic. \
                    ISO standard round to even is more rare than typically assumed \
                    as most decimal fractions are not exactly representable in binary. \
                    Our roundX() versions explore differences between current and potential future versions of round() \
                    in R. Further, provides (some partly related) C99 math lib functions not in base R.

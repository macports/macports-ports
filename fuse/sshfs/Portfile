description         SSH filesystem for FUSE
long_description    This is a filesystem client based on the \
                    SSH File Transfer Protocol. Since most SSH \
                    servers already support this protocol it is \
                    very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side \
                    there is nothing to do.  On the client side \
                    mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging \
                    into the server with ssh.

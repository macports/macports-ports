description         A kernel extension for Fuse4X

long_description    Fuse4X implements a mechanism that makes it          \
                    possible to implement a fully functional file        \
                    system in a user-space program on Mac OS X. It       \
                    aims to be API-compliant with the FUSE               \
                    (File-system in USErspace) mechanism that            \
                    originated on Linux.  Therefore, many existing       \
                    FUSE file systems become readily usable on Mac OS    \
                    X. This port provides the dynamically loadable       \
                    kernel extension at the core of Fuse4X.

# This port installs a kernel module, so it must be built for the same
# architecture as the kernel. We don't have a way to get that;
# build_arch is the userland architecture, which may be different
# (e.g. 64-bit userland with 32-bit kernel). So build a universal
# binary by default.

# kext destination: kext will be installed into ${kextdir}/fuse4x.kext.
#
# The kext is autoloaded by the library using load_fuse4x, so it
# doesn't have to go into /System/Library/Extensions. It doesn't
# matter where we put it, as long as it's kept in sync with the library.
#
# If updating the patchfile or ${kextdir}, must also update the
# corresponding patch in the fuse4x port!

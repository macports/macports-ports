description         UtahFS is an encrypted storage system that provides a \
                    user-friendly FUSE drive backed by cloud storage.

long_description    UtahFS is a state-of-the art encrypted storage solution, \
                    meant to be similar to Dropbox. It has a FUSE binding \
                    that creates a synthetic drive on the user's computer \
                    that they can interact with like an external hard-drive. \
                    Files stored in the drive are uploaded to a cloud storage \
                    provider, which means the drive will never run out of \
                    space and minimizes the likelihood of any files being \
                    lost. However the files are encrypted such that the cloud \
                    storage provider knows almost nothing about what's being \
                    stored.

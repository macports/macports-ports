# Usage:
# PortGroup       x11font 1.0
# x11font.setup   portname version fontsubdir
# where portname is just the name for the port (and should match the
# distname for simplicity), version is the port's version, and the fontsubdir
# is the subdirectory of ${prefix}/share/fonts used by this font.
# This automatically defines name, version, categories, homepage,
# master_sites, and depends_build as appropriate, and sets up
# configure.args, post-destroot, post-activate, and post-deactivate.

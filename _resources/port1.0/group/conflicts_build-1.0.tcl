# This PortGroup implements the "conflicts_build" option, which lets ports
# specify that they would fail to build properly if certain other ports are
# installed at configure, build and/or destroot time. This is in contrast to
# the MacPorts built-in "conflicts" option, which is for indicating activation-
# time conflicts (i.e. ports that install files in the same locations).
#
# Ideally the conflicts_build option should be integrated into MacPorts base
# instead of being a PortGroup.


# conflicts_build: the list of ports with which this port conflicts at
# configure, build and/or destroot time.

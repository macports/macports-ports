# Usage:
# PortGroup                 haskell-platform 1.0
# haskellplatform.setup     haskell_package version [register_scripts]
# where haskell_package is the name of the package (eg, digest), version is the
# version for it. This automatically defines name, version, categories,
# homepage, master_sites, distname, and depends_build as appropriate, and sets
# up the configure, build, destroot, and post-activate stages. It can do
# pre-deactivate if that ever becomes an option in MacPorts. register_scripts
# can be used to deactivate installing register.sh and unregister.sh as might be
# needed for non-library parts of the haskell platform. Set it to "no" to
# achieve this; defaults to "yes".

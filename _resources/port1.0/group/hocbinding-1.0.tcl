# This PortGroup automatically sets all the fields of the various hs-HOC
# bindings ports (e.g. hs-HOC-Foundation).
#
# Usage:
#
#   PortGroup        hocbinding 1.0
#   hocbinding.setup framework version source
#
# where framework is the name of the bound framework (e.g. Foundation), version
# is the version of the binding, and if the framework additional code is in HOC
# source itself, source is "hoc"; otherwise don't use source.
#
# Example:
#
#   PortGroup        hocbinding 1.0
#   hocbinding.setup Foundation 0.7-r413 hoc

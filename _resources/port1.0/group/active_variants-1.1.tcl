#   }
# } else {
#   # code to be executed if $depspec isn't active
# }
#
# where
#  $depspec
#    is the name of the port you're trying to check (required), which can be
#    specified as either just the port, or via "(bin|lib|path):FOO:port"
#    as accepted by the dependency parser.
#  $required
#    is a list of variants that must be enabled for the test to succeed
#    (required; remember this can also be a space-separated string or just
#    a string for a single value. It's interpreted as list, though.)
#  $forbidden
#    is a list of variants that may not be enabled for the test to succeed
#    (default is empty list, see description of $required for values that can be
#    interpreted as list by Tcl)
#
#
# In situations where you know that a version of the port is active (e.g., when
# checking in pre-configure of a port and the checked port is a dependency),
# this can be simplified to:
# if {[active_variants $depspec $required $forbidden]} {
#   # code to be run if $depspec is active with all from $required and none from
#   # $forbidden
# } else {
#   # code to be run if $depspec is active, but either not with all variants in
#   # $required or any variant in $forbidden
# }
#
# If all you want to do is bail out when the condition isn't fulfilled, there's
# a convenience wrapper available. If the condition isn't met it will print an
# error message and exit in a pre-configure phase. This can't be run any
# earlier, because not all dependency types are installed before configure
# phase. Previous versions of this PortGroup required you to manually put
# require_active_variants in a pre-configure block. This is now done
# automatically.
#
# require_active_variants $depspec $required $forbidden
#
# ChangeLog:
#  v1.1:
#   - require_active_variants no longer needs to be used in a pre-configure
#     phase manually, because it automatically wraps itself in pre-configure.
#   - the active_variants portgroup can now also deal with depspec-style
#     dependencies, e.g., require_active_variants path:foo/bar:standardport
#     variant

	# registry2.0/registry.tcl, line 173 and does some error handling plus
	# passing the call to the appropriate registry backend (flat file or
	# sqlite).
	#
	# In the SQLite case the call goes to registry2.0/receipt_sqlite.tcl,
	# line 45, proc active, which in turn calls registry::entry installed

	# there can never be multiple versions of the same port active at the

description         ESMTP library

long_description    libESMTP is a library to manage posting (or submission of) \
                    electronic mail using SMTP to a preconfigured Mail Transport \
                    Agent (MTA) such as Exim. It may be used as part of a Mail \
                    User Agent (MUA) or another program that must be able to \
                    post electronic mail but where mail functionality is not \
                    that program’s primary purpose. libESMTP is not intended \
                    to be used as part of a program that implements a Mail \
                    Transport Agent. It is hoped that the availability of a \
                    lightweight library implementing an SMTP client will both \
                    ease the task of coding for software authors and improve the \
                    quality of the resulting code.

long_description  The Spam Bouncer is a set of procmail recipes, or instructions, which \
                  search the headers and text of your incoming email to see if it meets \
                  one or more of several categories (known addresses, rogue ISPs, bulk \
                  mail software etc etc).\
                  \
                  The Spam Bouncer sorts suspected spam into two categories -- mail from \
                  known spam sources which is definitely spam, and other mail which is \
                  probably spam, but might also be legitimate. It then tags this email \
                  with appropriate headers giving the spam classification, and responds \
                  according to the parameters you have set.

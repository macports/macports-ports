## Settings for the Sieve interpreter

## Version 2.2.x (AR14759611)

# Do not forget to enable the Sieve plugin in 15-lda.conf and 20-lmtp.conf
# by adding it to the respective mail_plugins= settings.

  # The path to the user's main active script. If ManageSieve is used, this the
  # location of the symbolic link controlled by ManageSieve.

  # The default Sieve script when the user has none. This is a path to a global
  # sieve script file, which gets executed ONLY if user's private Sieve script
  # doesn't exist. Be sure to pre-compile this script manually using the sievec
  # command line tool.
  # --> See sieve_before fore executing scripts before the user's personal
  #     script.

  # is also where the ManageSieve service stores the user's scripts.

  # Directory for :global include scripts for the include extension.
  #sieve_global_dir =

  # Path to a script file or a directory containing script files that need to be
  # executed before the user's script. If the path points to a directory, all
  # the Sieve scripts contained therein (with the proper .sieve extension) are
  # executed. The order of execution within a directory is determined by the
  # file names, using a normal 8bit per-character comparison. Multiple script
  # file or directory paths can be specified by appending an increasing number.
  #sieve_before =
  #sieve_before2 =
  #sieve_before3 = (etc...)

  # Identical to sieve_before, only the specified scripts are executed after the
  # user's script (only when keep is still in effect!). Multiple script file or
  # directory paths can be specified by appending an increasing number.

  # Which Sieve language extensions are available to users. By default, all
  # supported extensions are available, except for deprecated extensions or
  # those that are still under development. Some system administrators may want
  # to disable certain Sieve extensions or enable those that are not available
  # by default. This setting can use '+' and '-' to specify differences relative
  # to the default. For example `sieve_extensions = +imapflags' will enable the
	# deprecated imapflags extension in addition to all extensions were already
  # enabled by default.
  #sieve_extensions = +notify +imapflags

  # Which Sieve language extensions are ONLY available in global scripts. This
  # can be used to restrict the use of certain Sieve extensions to administrator
  # control, for instance when these extensions can cause security concerns.
  # This setting has higher precedence than the `sieve_extensions' setting
  # (above), meaning that the extensions enabled with this setting are never
  # available to the user's personal script no matter what is specified for the
  # `sieve_extensions' setting. The syntax of this setting is similar to the
  # `sieve_extensions' setting, with the difference that extensions are
  # enabled or disabled for exclusive use in global scripts. Currently, no
  # extensions are marked as such by default.

  # The Pigeonhole Sieve interpreter can have plugins of its own. Using this
  # setting, the used plugins can be specified. Check the Dovecot wiki
  # (wiki2.dovecot.org) or the pigeonhole website
  # (http://pigeonhole.dovecot.org) for available plugins.
	# The sieve_extprograms plugin is included in this release.

  # The separator that is expected between the :user and :detail
  # address parts introduced by the subaddress extension. This may
  # also be a sequence of characters (e.g. '--'). The current
  # implementation looks for the separator from the left of the
  # localpart and uses the first one encountered. The :user part is
  # left of the separator and the :detail part is right. This setting
  # is also used by Dovecot's LMTP service.

  # execution. If set to 0, no limit on the total number of actions is enforced.

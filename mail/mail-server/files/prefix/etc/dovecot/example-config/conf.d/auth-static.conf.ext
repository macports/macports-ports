# Static passdb. Included from 10-auth.conf.

# This can be used for situations where Dovecot doesn't need to verify the
# username or the password, or if there is a single password for all users:
#
#  - proxy frontend, where the backend verifies the password
#  - proxy backend, where the frontend already verified the password
#  - authentication with SSL certificates
#  - simple testing

#passdb {
#  driver = static
#  args = proxy=y host=%1Mu.example.com nopassword=y
#}

#passdb {
#  driver = static
#  args = password=test
#}

#userdb {
#  driver = static
#  args = uid=vmail gid=vmail home=/home/%u
#}

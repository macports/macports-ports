# Static settings generated from template <doc/wiki/UserDatabase.Static.txt>
#userdb {

  # Can return anything a userdb could normally return. For example:
  #
  #  args = uid=500 gid=500 home=/var/mail/%u
  #
  # LDA and LMTP needs to look up users only from the userdb. This of course
  # doesn't work with static userdb because there is no list of users.
  # Normally static userdb handles this by doing a passdb lookup. This works
  # with most passdbs, with PAM being the most notable exception. If you do
  # the user verification another way, you can add allow_all_users=yes to
  # the args in which case the passdb lookup is skipped.

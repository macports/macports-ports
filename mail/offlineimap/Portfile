description		IMAP/Maildir synchronization and reader support
long_description	OfflineIMAP is a tool to simplify your e-mail reading.\
			With OfflineIMAP, you can:\
			- Read the same mailbox from multiple computers, and\
			  have your changes (deletions, etc.) be automatically\
			  reflected on all computers\
			- Use various mail clients to read a single mail box\
			- Read mail while offline (on a laptop) and have all\
			  changes synchronized when you get connected again\
			- Read IMAP mail with mail readers that do not support\
			  IMAP\
			- Use SSL (secure connections) to read IMAP mail even\
			  if your reader doesn't support SSL\
			- Synchronize your mail using a completely safe and\
			  fault-tolerant algorithm. (At least I think it is!)\
			- Customize which mailboxes to synchronize with regular\
			  expressions or lists\
			- Synchronize your mail two to four times faster than\
			  with other tools or other mail readers' internal IMAP\
			  support\
			In short, OfflineIMAP is a tool to let you read mail\
			how YOU want to.

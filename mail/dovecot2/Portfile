description         Secure, fast imap and pop3 server
long_description    Dovecot is an IMAP and POP3 server for Linux/UNIX-like \
                    systems, written with security primarily in mind. Although \
                    it's written in C, it uses several coding techniques to \
                    avoid most of the common pitfalls.

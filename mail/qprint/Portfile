description qprint encodes and decodes Quoted-Printable files
long_description    \
    qprint is a command line utility which encodes and decodes files in the \
    MIME format. It can be used within a pipeline as an encoding or decoding \
    filter, and is most commonly used in this manner as part of an automated \
    mail processing system. With appropriate options, qprint can encode pure \
    binary files, but it's a poor choice since it may inflate the size of the \
    file by as much as a factor of three. The base64 MIME encoding is a better \
    choice for such data.

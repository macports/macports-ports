    Modern full-featured open source secure mail server for low-maintenance \
    self-hosted email

    {*}${description}. \n\
    Mox features: \n\
    - Quick and easy to start/maintain mail server, for your own domain(s). \n\
    - SMTP (with extensions) for receiving and submitting email. \n\
    - IMAP4 (with extensions) for giving email clients access to email. \n\
    - Automatic TLS with ACME, for use with Let's Encrypt and other CA's. \n\
    - SPF, verifying that a remote host is allowed to sent email for a domain.  \n\
    - DKIM, verifying that a message is signed by the claimed sender domain, \
      and for signing emails sent by mox for others to verify. \n\
    - DMARC, for enforcing SPF/DKIM policies set by domains. Incoming DMARC \
      aggregate reports are analyzed. \n\
    - Reputation tracking, learning (per user) host- and domain-based \
      reputation from (Non-)Junk email. \n\
    - Bayesian spam filtering that learns (per user) from (Non-)Junk email. \n\
    - Slowing down senders with no/low reputation or questionable email \
      content (similar to greylisting). Rejected emails are stored in a \
      mailbox called Rejects for a short period, helping with misclassified \
      legitimate synchronous signup/login/transactional emails. \n\
    - Internationalized email, with unicode names in domains and usernames \
      ("localparts"). \n\
    - TLSRPT, parsing reports about TLS usage and issues. \n\
    - MTA-STS, for ensuring TLS is used whenever it is required. Both serving \
      of policies, and tracking and applying policies of remote servers. \n\
    - Web admin interface that helps you set up your domains and accounts \
      (instructions to create DNS records, configure \
      SPF/DKIM/DMARC/TLSRPT/MTA-STS), for status information, managing \
      accounts/domains, and modifying the configuration file. \n\
    - Autodiscovery (with SRV records, Microsoft-style and Thunderbird-style) \
      for easy account setup (though not many clients support it). \n\
    - Prometheus metrics and structured logging for operational insight.

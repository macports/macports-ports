long_description    ${description} \
                    Hosts that are blacklisted means that global spam email have been \
                    reported to contain links to these hosts. \
                    Many spam filtering programs use the SURBL to aid in the filtering \
                    process, but this program can serve many other needs. In fact, it \
                    was written to provide safe URL redirection at memurl.com.

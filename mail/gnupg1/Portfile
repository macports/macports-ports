description         GNU Privacy Guard version 1.4
long_description    GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP. Because \
                    it does not use the patented IDEA algorithm, it can be used \
                    without any restrictions. GnuPG is a RFC4880 (OpenPGP) \
                    compliant application.

notes {
    This port is the legacy 1.4 release of GnuPG.

    While this release is still maintained, it is also deprecated\
    and less useful than it was before, since agent and dirmngr\
    support have been removed.

    Basic functionality like signature checking or encryption\
    and decryption might still work, if the algorithms employed\
    are supported, but users are highly recommended to switch to\
    the modern version of GnuPG, provided by the gnupg2 port.

    This port will be made co-installable with the modern version\
    in mid-October 2018. All binaries will be postfixed with "1"\
    and dependents switched over to pull in modern GnuPG,\
    eventually forcing an upgrade. After this date, this port will\
    still be provided for users that need to work on old data,\
    which is not supported by the modern version any longer, but\
    not used within MacPorts.

.SH NAME
\fBM2VRequantiser\fP - MPEG-2 streams requantization
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

\fBM2VRequantiser\fP

\fBM2VRequantiser\fP <RECOMPRESSION_FACTOR> <inputM2Vsize>

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBM2VRequantiser\fP is a tool that requantizes MPEG-2 streams without
recompressing. \fBM2VRequantiser\fP accepts raw MPEG-2 video data (not VOB)
from standard input and writes the recompressed frames to standard output.
.PP
\fBM2VRequantiser\fP represents a good replacement for tcrequant, an obsolete
utility provided by some versions of the transcode suite.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBM2VRequantiser\fP accepts the raw MPEG-2 video data (not VOB) from the standard
input and writes the recompressed frames to the standard output.
.PP
\fBM2VRequantiser\fP takes two arguments. The first is a floating point value
specifying the ratio of compression. The second is the size of the M2V. (Since
the data is streamed to \fBM2VRequantiser\fP it cannot know the M2V size.)
.PP
There aren't any options and the usage is:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ M2VRequantiser <RECOMPRESSION_FACTOR> <inputM2Vsize>
.fam T
.fi
.SH EXAMPLE
The following command would recompress 'original.m2v', whose size is
1024000 bytes, by a factor of 1.25:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ M2VRequantiser 1.25 1024000 < original.m2v > requantised.m2v

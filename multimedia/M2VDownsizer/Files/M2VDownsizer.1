.SH NAME
\fBM2VDownsizer\fP - Re-compresses MPEG-2 video streams
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBM2VDownsizer\fP <lowering factor> <quality 0=fast...3=high quality>
<input m2v size in bytes>
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBM2VDownsizer\fP is a tool that re-compresses MPEG-2 (or m2v) video streams.
In other words, \fBM2VDownsizer\fP will perform a complete decompression and
recompression of MPEG-2 video streams for the best possible video quality.
.PP
\fBM2VDownsizer\fP accepts the raw MPEG-2 (or m2v) video data (not VOB) from
the standard input and writes the recompressed video frames to the standard
output.
.PP
Be forewarned! Decompression and recompression  could take hours for large
MPEG-2 video streams!  It is recommended that one first tries transcoding
MPEG-2 streams using \fBM2VRequantiser\fP since transcoding is a lot faster and
produces excellent results for most MPEG-2 video streams. \fBM2VDownsizer\fP is
only intended to be used for large MPEG-2 video streams when transcoding does
not produce acceptable results.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBM2VDownsizer\fP takes three arguments and does not have any options. The
usage is:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ M2VDownsizer <lowering factor> <quality 0=fast...3=high quality>
    <input m2v size in bytes>
.fam T
.fi
.PP
The first argument is a floating point value specifying the lowering factor for
re-compression. The higher the lowering factor, the higher the re-compression
will be. The second argument is an integer value from 0 to 3 specifying the
quality of the re-compressed MPEG-2 output video (0=lowest quality and
3=highest quality). The third argument is the size of the MPEG-2 input video in
bytes. (Since the MPEG-2 video is streamed into \fBM2VDownsizer\fP, the program
is unable to determine the MPEG-2 input video size).
.PP
To shrink MPEG-2 video from a DVD-9 disc to fit on a DVD-5 disc, a lowering
factor of 1.5 works well in most cases. Alternatively, use the following
formula to more precisely calculate the lowering factor:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    lowering factor = (( Total m2v video size in bytes / 
    (4700000000 - Total audio size in bytes)) * 1.04
.fam T
.fi
.SH EXAMPLE
The following command would re-compress 'original.m2v', whose size is
5,974,039,472 bytes, by a lowering factor of 1.46 with the highest quality of
3:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ M2VDownsizer 1.46 3 5974039472 < original.m2v > re-compressed.m2v
.fam T
.fi
.PP
It will take a long time for \fBM2VDownsizer\fP to completely decompress and
recompress the MPEG-2 video in the above example.  Time to take a long coffee
break!

description	utility to convert .tivo files into mpeg
long_description	This software converts a .TiVo file (produced   \
	by the TiVoToGo functionality on recent TiVo software releases) \
	to a normal MPEG file. This has the same functionality as using \
	TiVo's supplied DirectShow DLL on Windows with a tool such as   \
	DirectShowDump, but is portable to different architectures and  \
	operating systems, and runs on the command line using files or  \
	pipes. The conversion still requires the valid MAK of the TiVo  \
	which recorded the file, so it cannot be used to circumvent     \
	their protection, simply to provide the same level of access as \
	is already available on Windows.

description         Command-line utility that extracts streams from various services \
                    and pipes them into a video player of choice.

long_description    Livestreamer is a command-line utility that pipes video streams \
                    from various services into a video player such as VLC. \
                    The main purpose of Livestreamer is to allow the user to avoid buggy \
                    and CPU heavy flash plugins but still be able to enjoy various \
                    streamed content. There is also an API available for developers \
                    who want access to the video stream data.

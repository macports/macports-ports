description         DBIx::Class::IntrospectableM2M - Introspect many-to-many shortcuts
long_description    Because the many-to-many relationships are not real relationships, \
                    they can not be introspected with DBIx::Class. Many-to-many \
                    relationships are actually just a collection of convenience methods \
                    installed to bridge two relationships. This DBIx::Class component \
                    can be used to store all relevant information about these non-relationships \
                    so they can later be introspected and examined.

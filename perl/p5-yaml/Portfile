long_description    The YAML.pm module implements a YAML Loader and Dumper \
                    based on the YAML 1.0 specification.  YAML is a \
                    generic data serialization language that is optimized \
                    for human readability.  It can be used to express the \
                    data structures of most modern programming languages.

description         Authenticating the Yubikey against the Yubico Web API

long_description    Authenticate against the Yubico server via the Web API in Perl. Before \
                    you can use this module, you need to register for an API key at Yubico. \
                    This is as simple as logging onto <https://api.yubico.com/yms/getapi.php> \
                    and entering your Yubikey's OTP and a brief description. Once you have \
                    the API and ID, you need to provide those details to the module to work.

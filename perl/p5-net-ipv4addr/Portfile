description             Parse IPv4 addresses in traditional and CIDR formats
long_description        Net::IPv4Addr provides functions for parsing IPv4 \
                        addresses both in traditional address/netmask format \
                        and in the new CIDR format.  There are also methods \
                        for calculating the network and broadcast address and \
                        also to see check if a given address is in a specific \
                        network.

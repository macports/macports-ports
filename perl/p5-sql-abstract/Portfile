description          Generate SQL from Perl data structures
long_description     This module was inspired by the excellent DBIx::Abstract. \
                     However, in using that module I found that what I really \
                     wanted to do was generate SQL, but still retain complete \
                     control over my statement handles and use the DBI \
                     interface. So, I set out to create an abstract SQL \
                     generation module.

description         Assorted astronomical routines for perl
long_description    Astro::Time, Astro::Coord and Astro::Misc provide a collection of useful \
                    astronomical routines written entirely in Perl.  The routines provided include \
                    various time conversions, coordinate transformations, and string parsing as \
                    well as a number of astronomical tools. \
                    \
                    These routines should be used at your own risk! Most should give \
                    reasonable accurate results, but spot checks against your favorite \
                    program are recommenced. The B1950/J2000/Galactic coordinate routines \
                    are based on SLALIB routines and agree very closely.

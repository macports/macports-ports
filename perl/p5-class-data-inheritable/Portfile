description         Inheritable, overridable class data
long_description    Class::Data::Inheritable is for creating \
                    accessor/mutators to class data. That is, if you want to \
                    store something about your class as a whole (instead of \
                    about a single object). This data is then inherited \
                    by your subclasses and can be overriden.

description         Base class for implementing various dependency trees
long_description    Algorithm::Dependency is a framework for creating simple \
                    read-only dependency hierarchies, where you have a set \
                    of items that rely on other items in the set, and \
                    require actions on them as well.  Despite the most \
                    visible of these being software installation systems \
                    like the CPAN installer, or debian apt-get, they are \
                    usefull in other situations. This module intentionally \
                    uses implementation-neutral words, to avoid confusion.

description         Cross-platform interface to ICMP 'ping' utilities
long_description    Net::Ping::External is a module which interfaces \
                    with the 'ping' command on many systems.  It \
                    presently provides a single function, 'ping()', \
                    that takes in a hostname and (optionally) a timeout \
                    and returns true if the host is alive, and false \
                    otherwise.  Unless you have the ability (and \
                    willingness) to run your scripts as the superuser \
                    on your system, this module will probably provide \
                    more accurate results than Net::Ping will.

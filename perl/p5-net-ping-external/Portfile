description		Cross-platform interface to ICMP 'ping' utilities
long_description	Net::Ping::External is a module which interfaces \
			with the 'ping' command on many systems.  It \
			presently provides a single function, 'ping()', \
			that takes in a hostname and (optionally) a timeout \
			and returns true if the host is alive, and false \
			otherwise.  Unless you have the ability (and \
			willingness) to run your scripts as the superuser \
			on your system, this module will probably provide \
			more accurate results than Net::Ping will.

description         Perl OpenGL: a.k.a. POGL
long_description    Perl OpenGL (a.k.a. POGL) is a perl5 interface to \
                    opengl, glu, and glut. Virtually all of the OpenGL 1.0 and 1.1 \
                    functions are available as well as most of 1.2.  The functional \
                    interface is very similar to using C with most changes made in an \
                    obvious way (see man page for details).  High-level object interfaces \
                    are available in the form of OpenGL::Array, OpenGL::Image, and \
                    OpenGL::Shader.

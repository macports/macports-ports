description         Handy web browsing in a Perl object
long_description    WWW::Mechanize, or Mech for short, helps you automate \
                    interaction with a website. It supports performing a \
                    sequence of page fetches including following links and \
                    submitting forms. Each fetched page is parsed and its \
                    links and forms are extracted. A link or a form can be \
                    selected, form fields can be filled and the next page \
                    can be fetched. Mech also stores a history of the URLs \
                    you have visited, which can be queried and revisited.

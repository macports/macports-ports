description         Perl extension for stripping HTML markup from text.
long_description    This module simply strips HTML-like markup from text \
                    in a very quick and brutal manner. It could quite \
                    easily be used to strip XML or SGML from text as \
                    well\; but removing HTML markup is a much more common \
                    problem, hence this module lives in the \
                    HTML::namespace.

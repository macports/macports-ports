description         Perl interface to Monotone via automate stdio
long_description    The Monotone::AutomateStdio class gives a Perl developer \
                    access to the Monotone automate stdio facility via an easy \
                    to use interface. All command, option and output formats \
                    are handled internally by this class. Any structured \
                    information returned by Monotone is parsed and returned \
                    back to the caller as lists of records for ease of \
                    access or alternatively as one large string.

description         Line wrapping module with support for multibyte, fullwidth, and combining characters and languages without whitespaces between words
long_description    This module intends to be a better Text::Wrap \
                    module. This module is needed to support \
                    multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8, \
                    EUC-JP, EUC-KR, GB2312, and Big5. This module \
                    also supports characters with irregular widths, \
                    such as combining characters (which occupy zero \
                    columns on terminal, like diacritical marks in \
                    UTF-8) and fullwidth characters (which occupy \
                    two columns on terminal, like most of east \
                    Asian characters). Also, minimal handling of \
                    languages which do not use whitespaces between \
                    words (like Chinese and Japanese) is supported.

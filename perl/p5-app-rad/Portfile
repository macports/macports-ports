description         Rapid (and easy!) creation of command line applications

long_description    App::Rad aims to be a simple yet powerful framework for \
                    developing your command-line applications. It can easily \
                    transform your Perl one-liners into reusable subroutines \
                    than can be called directly by the user of your program. \
                    It also tries to provide a handy interface for your \
                    common command-line tasks.

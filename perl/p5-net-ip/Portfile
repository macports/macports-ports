description		Perl extension for manipulating IPv4/IPv6 addresses
long_description	Net-IP  rovides functions to deal with IPv4/IPv6 \
                    addresses. The module can be used as a class, \
                    allowing the user to instantiate IP objects, \
                    which can be single IP addresses, prefixes, \
                    or ranges of addresses. There is also a procedural \
                    way of accessing most of the functions. Most subroutines \
                     can take either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses transparently.

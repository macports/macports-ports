description         use references as hash keys
long_description    This module provides the ability to use references as \
                    hash keys if you first tie the hash variable to this \
                    module. Normally, only the keys of the tied hash itself \
                    are preserved as references\; to use references as keys \
                    in hashes-of-hashes, use Tie::RefHash::Nestable, \
                    included as part of Tie::RefHash.

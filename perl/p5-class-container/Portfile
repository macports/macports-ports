description         Glues object frameworks together transparently
long_description    This class facilitates building frameworks of several classes that \
                    inter-operate. It was first designed and built for HTML::Mason, in \
                    which the Compiler, Lexer, Interpreter, Resolver, Component, Buffer, \
                    and several other objects must create each other transparently, passing \
                    the appropriate parameters to the right class, possibly substituting \
                    other subclasses for any of these objects.

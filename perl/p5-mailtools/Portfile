description         Mail-related Perl modules (recommended legacy use only)

long_description    MailTools is a set of Perl modules related to mail \
                    applications. These modules are very old (partially \
                    written before MIME!). If you're starting a new e-mail \
                    application, consider using MailBox instead (p5-mail-box \
                    in MacPorts). It is a little harder to learn, but at \
                    least implements all RFCs correctly.

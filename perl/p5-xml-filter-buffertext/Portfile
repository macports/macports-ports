description         Simple text filter
long_description    This is a very simple filter. One common cause of grief (and programmer \
                    error) is that XML parsers aren't required to provide character events in one \
                    chunk. They can, but are not forced to, and most don't. This filter does the \
                    trivial but oft-repeated task of putting all characters into a single event.

description           IO::-style interface to Compress::Zlib
long_description      This modules provides an IO:: style interface to the \
                      Compress::Zlib package. The main advantage is that you \
                      can use an IO::Zlib object in much the same way as an \
                      IO::File object so you can have common code that doesn't \
                      know which sort of file it is using.

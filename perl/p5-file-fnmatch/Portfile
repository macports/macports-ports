description         Exposes your system's fnmatch(3) capabilities to Perl.
long_description    File::FnMatch exposes your system's fnmatch(3) \
                    capabilities to Perl.  While considerably less powerful \
                    than regular expressions, shell-style patterns are yet \
                    useful and familiar to a large audience of end-users.

long_description    Simple platform independent e-mail from your perl \
                    script. Only requires Perl 5 and a network connection. \
                    Mail::Sendmail contains mainly &sendmail, which takes a \
                    hash with the message to send and sends it. It is \
                    intended to be very easy to setup and use.

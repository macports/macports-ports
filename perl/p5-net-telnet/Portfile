description          Interact with TELNET port or other TCP ports
long_description     Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a \
                     TCP port and do network I/O, especially to a port using \
                     the TELNET protocol.  Simple I/O methods such as print, \
                     get, and getline are provided.  More sophisticated \
                     interactive features are provided because connecting to \
                     a TELNET port ultimately means communicating with a \
                     program designed for human interaction.  These \
                     interactive features include the ability to specify a \
                     time-out and to wait for patterns to appear in the input \
                     stream, such as the prompt from a shell.

description         RSA MD5 implementation for perl
long_description    The Digest::MD5 module allows you to use the \
                    RSA Data Security Inc. MD5 Message Digest algorithm \
                    from within Perl programs.  The algorithm takes as \
                    input a message of arbitrary length and produces \
                    as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" \
                    of the input. MD5 is described in RFC 1321.

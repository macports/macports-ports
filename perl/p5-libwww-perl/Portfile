description                  The World-Wide Web library for Perl
long_description             The libwww-perl collection is a set of Perl \
                             modules which provides a simple and consistent \
                             application programming interface to the \
                             World-Wide Web.  The main focus of the library \
                             is to provide classes and functions that allow \
                             you to write WWW clients. The library also \
                             contain modules that are of more general use \
                             and even classes that help you implement \
                             simple HTTP servers.

notes \
    "As of version 6.00, libwww-perl has been broken up into multiple" \
    "packages.  If you were using ${name} for just one or two of its" \
    "modules before, you may be able to pare down your installation to" \
    "just those modules now.  Other important changes have been made that" \
    "may affect your code; for details, please see:" \

# Starting with version 6.02, LWP::Protocol::https began to be packaged
# separately from libwww-perl as well.  The thinking seems to have been that
# any package requiring HTTPS support would just declare an extra dependency
# on LWP::Protocol::https, and those that didn't, wouldn't.
#
# However, at this writing, there are 59 ports in MacPorts that depend on
# p5-libwww-perl, and I don't want to audit them all for their HTTPS
# requirements.  So in keeping with the Principle of Least Astonishment while
# recognizing that some people won't need or want the extra modules installed,
# I've decided to add a new variant and have it enabled by default.

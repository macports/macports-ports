description         Perl extension for getting CPU information
long_description    In response to a post on perlmonks.org, a module \
                    for counting the number of CPUs on a system. \
                    Support has now also been added for type of CPU \
                    and clock speed.

# Sys::CPU has been deleted from CPAN but is still required by port creduce
# source is now only available from BackPAN archive

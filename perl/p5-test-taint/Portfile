description         tools to test taintedness

long_description    ${name} provides ${description}. \
                    Tainted data is data that comes from an unsafe source, \
                    such as the command line, or, in the case of web apps, \
                    any GET or POST transactions. When you're writing unit \
                    tests for code that deals with tainted data, you'll want \
                    to have a way to provide tainted data for your routines \
                    to handle, and easy ways to check and report on the \
                    taintedness of your data, in standard Test::More style.

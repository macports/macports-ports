description         Import::Into - import packages into other packages

long_description    Writing exporters is a pain. Some use Exporter, some use \
                    Sub::Exporter, some use Moose::Exporter, some use \
                    Exporter::Declare ... and some things are pragmas. \
                    \
                    Exporting on someone else's behalf is harder. The \
                    exporters don't provide a consistent API for this, and \
                    pragmas need to have their import method called directly, \
                    since they affect the current unit of compilation. \
                    \
                    Import::Into provides global methods to make this painless.

description         Efficient reading/writing of complete files
long_description    This module provides subs that allow you to read or \
                    write entire files with one simple call. They are \
                    designed to be simple to use, have flexible ways to pass \
                    in or get the file contents and to be very efficient. \
                    There is also a sub to read in all the files in a \
                    directory other than . and .. These slurp/spew subs work \
                    for files, pipes and sockets, and stdio, pseudo-files, \
                    and DATA.

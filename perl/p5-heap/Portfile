description         Collection of routines for managing a heap data structure
long_description    This is a collection of routines for managing a heap \
                    data structure. There are two major components: a heap \
                    component, and an element component. \
                    A heap package basically keeps a collection of elements \
                    and is able to return the smallest one. \
                    The heap component interface is defined in Heap(3) and \
                    must be supported by all heap packages.  Currently there \
                    are three heap components provided: Heap::Fibonacci \
                    (the preferred one), Heap::Binomial, and Heap::Binary

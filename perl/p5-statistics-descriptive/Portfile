description         basic perl functions providing descriptive statistics
long_description    Statistics::Descriptive provides basic functions used in descriptive \
                    statistics. It has an object oriented design and supports two different \
                    types of data storage and calculation objects: sparse and full. With the \
                    sparse method, none of the data is stored and only a few statistical \
                    measures are available. Using the full method, the entire data set is \
                    retained and additional functions are available. \
                    \
                    Whenever a division by zero may occur, the denominator is checked to be \
                    greater than the value \$Statistics::Descriptive::Tolerance, which defaults \
                    to 0.0. You may want to change this value to some small positive value such \
                    as 1e-24 in order to obtain error messages in case of very small \
                    denominators. \
                    \
                    Many of the methods (both Sparse and Full) cache values so that subsequent \
                    calls with the same arguments are faster.

description         A module to make it simple to drop all privileges, \
                    even POSIX groups.

long_description    This module tries to simplify the process of dropping \
    privileges. This can be useful when your Perl program needs to bind \
    to privileged ports, etc. This module is much like Proc::UID, except \
    that it's implemented in pure Perl. Special care has been taken to \
    also drop saved uid on platforms that support this, currently only \
    test on on Linux.

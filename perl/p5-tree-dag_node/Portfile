description         A (super)class for representing nodes in a tree
long_description    This class encapsulates/makes/manipulates objects that \
                    represent nodes in a tree structure.  The tree structure \
                    is not an object itself, but is emergent from the linkages \
                    you create between nodes.  This class provides the methods \
                    for making linkages that can be used to build up a tree, \
                    while preventing you from ever making any kinds of \
                    linkages which are not allowed in a tree (such as having \
                    a node be its own mother or ancestor, or having a node \
                    have two mothers).

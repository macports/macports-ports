description             Net::IP::Match::Regexp - Efficiently match IP addresses against ranges

long_description        This module allows you to check an IP address against one \
			or more IP ranges. It employs Perl's highly optimized \
			regular expression engine to do the hard work, so it is \
			very fast. It is optimized for speed by doing the match \
			against a regexp which implicitly checks the broadest IP \
			ranges first. An advantage is that the regexp can be \
			computed and stored in advance (in source code, in a \
			database table, etc) and reused, saving much time if the \
			IP ranges don't change too often. The match can optionally \
			report a value (e.g. a network name) instead of just a boolean, \
			which makes module useful for mapping IP ranges to names \
			or codes or anything else.

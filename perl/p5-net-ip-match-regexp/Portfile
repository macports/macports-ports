description         Net::IP::Match::Regexp - Efficiently match IP addresses against ranges

long_description    This module allows you to check an IP address against one \
                    or more IP ranges. It employs Perl's highly optimized \
                    regular expression engine to do the hard work, so it is \
                    very fast. It is optimized for speed by doing the match \
                    against a regexp which implicitly checks the broadest IP \
                    ranges first. An advantage is that the regexp can be \
                    computed and stored in advance (in source code, in a \
                    database table, etc) and reused, saving much time if the \
                    IP ranges don't change too often. The match can optionally \
                    report a value (e.g. a network name) instead of just a boolean, \
                    which makes module useful for mapping IP ranges to names \
                    or codes or anything else.

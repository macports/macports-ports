description         Text::CSV - comma-separated values manipulation routines
long_description    Text::CSV provides facilities for the composition and \
                    decomposition of comma-separated values. An instance \
                    of the Text::CSV class can combine fields into a CSV \
                    string and parse a CSV string into fields.

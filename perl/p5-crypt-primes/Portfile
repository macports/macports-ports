description         Provable Prime Number Generator suitable for Cryptographic Applications.
long_description    This module implements Ueli Maurer's algorithm for generating large provable \
                    primes and secure parameters for public-key cryptosystems. The generated \
                    primes are almost uniformly distributed over the set of primes of the specified \
                    bitsize and expected time for generation is less than the time required for \
                    generating a pseudo-prime of the same size with Miller-Rabin tests.

description         graph operations for perl
long_description    This is Graph, a Perl module for dealing with graphs, the abstract \
                    data structures.  (If you were looking for pie charts, I'm sorry.) \
                    \
                    This is a full rewrite of the Graph module 0.2xx series as discussed \
                    in the book \"Mastering Algorithms with Perl\", written by Jarkko \
                    Hietaniemi (the undersigned), John Macdonald, and Jon Orwant, \
                    and published by O'Reilly and Associates.

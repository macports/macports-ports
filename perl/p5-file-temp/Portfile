description			return name and handle of a temporary file safely
long_description	File::Temp can be used to create and open temporary files \
					in a safe way. There is both a function interface and an \
					object-oriented interface. The File::Temp constructor or \
					the tempfile() function can be used to return the name \
					and the open filehandle of a temporary file. The tempdir() \
					function can be used to create a temporary directory.

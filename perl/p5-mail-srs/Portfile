description         Mail::SRS - Interface to Sender Rewriting Scheme

long_description    The Sender Rewriting Scheme preserves .forward \
                    functionality in an SPF-compliant world. \
                    \
                    SPF requires the SMTP client IP to match the envelope \
                    sender (return-path). When a message is forwarded through \
                    an intermediate server, that intermediate server may \
                    need to rewrite the return-path to remain SPF compliant. \
                    If the message bounces, that intermediate server needs to \
                    validate the bounce and forward the bounce to the \
                    original sender. \
                    \
                    SRS provides a convention for return-path rewriting which \
                    allows multiple forwarding servers to compact the \
                    return-path. \
                    SRS also provides an authentication mechanism to ensure \
                    that purported bounces are not arbitrarily forwarded. \
                    \
                    SRS is documented at http://spf.pobox.com/srs.html and \
                    many points about the scheme are discussed at \
                    http://www.anarres.org/projects/srs/ \
                    \
                    For a better understanding of this code and how it \
                    functions, please read this document and run the \
                    interactive walkthrough in eg/simple.pl in this \

description         LWP::Protocol::https - SSL support for libwww-perl
long_description    The LWP::Protocol::https module used to be bundled with p5-libwww-perl, \
                    but it was unbundled in v6.02 so that dependencies could be declared \
                    properly.  Ports that need https support can just declare their \
                    dependency on ${name} and will no longer need to know what \
                    underlying modules to install.

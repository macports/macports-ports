description           Cache::Cache, the Cache interface
long_description      The Cache modules are designed to assist a developer \
                      in persisting data for a specified period of time. \
                      Often these modules are used in web applications to \
                      store data locally to save repeated and redundant \
                      expensive calls to remote machines or databases. \
                      People have also been known to use Cache::Cache for \
                      its straightforward interface in sharing data between \
                      runs of an application or invocations of a CGI-style \
                      script or simply as an easy to use abstraction of the \
                      filesystem or shared memory.

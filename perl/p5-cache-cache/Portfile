description         Cache::Cache, the Cache interface
long_description    The Cache modules are designed to assist a developer \
                    in persisting data for a specified period of time. \
                    Often these modules are used in web applications to \
                    store data locally to save repeated and redundant \
                    expensive calls to remote machines or databases. \
                    People have also been known to use Cache::Cache for \
                    its straightforward interface in sharing data between \
                    runs of an application or invocations of a CGI-style \
                    script or simply as an easy to use abstraction of the \
                    filesystem or shared memory.

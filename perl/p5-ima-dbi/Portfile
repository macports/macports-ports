description           Database connection caching and organization
long_description      Ima::DBI attempts to organize and facilitate caching \
                      and more efficient use of database connections and \
                      statement handles by storing DBI and SQL information \
                      with your class (instead of as seperate objects). This \
                      allows you to pass around just one object without \
                      worrying about a trail of DBI handles behind it.

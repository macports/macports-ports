description			Database connection caching and organization 
long_description \
	Ima::DBI attempts to organize and facilitate caching and more efficient \
	use of database connections and statement handles by storing DBI and \
	SQL information with your class (instead of as seperate objects). This \
	allows you to pass around just one object without worrying about a \
	trail of DBI handles behind it.

## # Perl searches vendor location last, so this won't
## # override the older version included with perl
## # if we install it in the vendor location
## set perl5.lib   ${prefix}/lib/perl5/${perl5.version}

## configure.args

## Test-Harness includes the 'prove' binary, which is used to run tests.  Sigh.

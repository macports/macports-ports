description         Emulate file interface for in-core strings
long_description    The IO::String module provides the IO::File interface \
                    for in-core strings. An IO::String object can be \
                    attached to a string, and makes it possible to use the \
                    normal file operations for reading or writing data, as \
                    well as for seeking to various locations of the string. \
                    This is useful when you want to use a library module \
                    that only provides an interface to file handles on data \
                    that you have in a string variable.

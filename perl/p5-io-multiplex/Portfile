description         Manage IO on many file handles
long_description    IO::Multiplex is designed to take the effort out of \
                    managing multiple file handles. It is essentially a \
                    really fancy front end to the select system calls. In \
                    addition to maintaining the select loop, it buffers all\
                    input and output to/from the file handles.  It can also \
                    accept incoming connections on one or more listen sockets.

description		set of modules for parsing and evaluating XPath statements
long_description	This module aims to comply exactly to the XPath \
				specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath and yet allow \
				extensions to be added in the form of functions. Modules such \
				as XSLT and XPointer may need to do this as they support \
				functionality beyond XPath.

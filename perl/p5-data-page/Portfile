description               help when paging through sets of results
long_description          When searching through large amounts of data, it is \
                          often the case that a result set is returned that \
                          is larger than we want to display on one page. This \
                          results in wanting to page through various pages of \
                          data. The maths behind this is unfortunately fiddly, \
                          hence this module.

description         help when paging through sets of results
long_description    When searching through large amounts of data, it is \
                    often the case that a result set is returned that \
                    is larger than we want to display on one page. This \
                    results in wanting to page through various pages of \
                    data. The maths behind this is unfortunately fiddly, \
                    hence this module.

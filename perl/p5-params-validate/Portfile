description         Validate method/function parameters
long_description    The Params::Validate module allows you to validate method \
                    or function call parameters to an arbitrary level of \
                    specificity.  At the simplest level, it is capable of \
                    validating the required parameters were given and that no \
                    unspecified additional parameters were passed in. It is \
                    also capable of determining that a parameter is of a \
                    specific type, that it is an object of a certain class \
                    hierarchy, that it possesses certain methods, or applying \
                    validation callbacks to arguments.

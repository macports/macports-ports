description			Compile and link C code for Perl modules
long_description \
	This module can build the C portions of Perl modules by invoking the \
	appropriate compilers and linkers in a cross-platform manner.  It was \
	motivated by the Module::Build project, but may be useful for other \
	purposes as well.  However, it is not intended as a general \
	cross-platform interface to all your C building needs.  That would have \
	been a much more ambitious goal!

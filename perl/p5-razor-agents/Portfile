description		a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and filter network
long_description	Vipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam \
					detection and filtering network. Through user \
					contribution, Razor establishes a distributed and \
					constantly updating catalogue of spam in propagation \
					that is consulted by email clients to filter out \
					known spam.  Detection is done with statistical and \
					randomized signatures that efficiently spot mutating \
					spam content. User input is validated through \
					reputation assignments based on consensus on report \
					and revoke assertions which in turn is used for \
					computing confidence values associated with \
					individual signatures.

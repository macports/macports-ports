description         A distributed, collaborative, spam detection and filter network
long_description    Vipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam \
                    detection and filtering network. Through user \
                    contribution, Razor establishes a distributed and \
                    constantly updating catalogue of spam in propagation \
                    that is consulted by email clients to filter out \
                    known spam.  Detection is done with statistical and \
                    randomized signatures that efficiently spot mutating \
                    spam content. User input is validated through \
                    reputation assignments based on consensus on report \
                    and revoke assertions which in turn is used for \
                    computing confidence values associated with \
                    individual signatures.

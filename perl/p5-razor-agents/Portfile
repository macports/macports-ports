description		A distributed, collaborative, spam detection and filter network
long_description	Vipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam \
			detection and filtering network. Through user \
			contribution, Razor establishes a distributed and \
			constantly updating catalogue of spam in propagation \
			that is consulted by email clients to filter out \
			known spam.  Detection is done with statistical and \
			randomized signatures that efficiently spot mutating \
			spam content. User input is validated through \
			reputation assignments based on consensus on report \
			and revoke assertions which in turn is used for \
			computing confidence values associated with \
			individual signatures.

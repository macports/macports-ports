description         Perl interface to the Imlib2 image library
long_description    Image::Imlib2 is a Perl port of Imlib2, a graphics library that \
                    does image file loading and saving as well as manipulation, \
                    arbitrary polygon support, etc. It does ALL of these operations \
                    FAST. It allows you to create colour images using a large number \
                    of graphics primitives, and output the images in a range of \
                    formats. \
                    Note that this is an early version of my attempt at a Perl \
                    interface to Imlib2. Currently, the API is just to test things \
                    out. Not everything is supported, but a great deal of \
                    functionality already exists. If you think the API can be \
                    tweaked to be a bit more intuitive, drop me a line!

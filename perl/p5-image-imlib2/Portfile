description			Perl interface to the Imlib2 image library
long_description \
	Image::Imlib2 is a Perl port of Imlib2, a graphics library that \
	does image file loading and saving as well as manipulation, \
	arbitrary polygon support, etc. It does ALL of these operations \
	FAST. It allows you to create colour images using a large number \
	of graphics primitives, and output the images in a range of \
	formats. \
	Note that this is an early version of my attempt at a Perl \
	interface to Imlib2. Currently, the API is just to test things \
	out. Not everything is supported, but a great deal of \
	functionality already exists. If you think the API can be \
	tweaked to be a bit more intuitive, drop me a line!

description         binary buffers for perl
long_description    Data::Buffer implements a low-level binary buffer \
                    in which you can get and put integers, strings, \
                    and other data. Internally the implementation is \
                    based on pack and unpack, such that Data::Buffer \
                    is really a layer on top of those built-in functions.

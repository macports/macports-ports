description         A simple string tokenizer.
long_description    A simple string tokenizer which takes a string and \
                    splits it on whitespace. It also optionally takes \
                    a string of characters to use as delimiters, and \
                    returns them with the token set as well. This allows \
                    for splitting the string in many different ways.

description         Provide a pseudo-class NEXT (et al) that allows method redispatch
long_description    NEXT.pm adds a pseudoclass named NEXT to any program \
                    that uses it. If a method m calls \$self-NEXT::m()>, the \
                    call to m is redispatched as if the calling method had \
                    not originally been found.

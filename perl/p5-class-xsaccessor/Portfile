description         Generate fast XS accessors without runtime compilation
long_description    Class::XSAccessor implements fast read, write and \
                    read/write accessors in XS. Additionally, it can \
                    provide predicates such as has_foo() for testing \
                    whether the attribute foo is defined in the object.

description         Perl Module to get German holidays
long_description    This module creates a list of German holidays in a \
                    given year.  It knows about special holiday regulations\
                    for all of Germany's federal states and also about \
                    "semi-holidays" that will be treated as holidays on \
                    request.  Holidays that occur on weekends can be \
                    excluded from the generated list.  The generated list \
                    can be freely formatted using regular strftime() \
                    format definitions.

description		Perl Module to get German holidays
long_description	This module creates a list of German holidays in a \
			given year.  It knows about special holiday regulations\
			for all of Germany's federal states and also about \
			"semi-holidays" that will be treated as holidays on \
			request.  Holidays that occur on weekends can be \
			excluded from the generated list.  The generated list \
			can be freely formatted using regular strftime() \
			format definitions.

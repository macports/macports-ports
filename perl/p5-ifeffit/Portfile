# IMPORTANT BUILD NOTES
#
# ifeffit, pgplot and p5-ifeffit need to be using the same compiler libraries.
# therefore they must be built with the same gcc compiler variants.
# currently this is gcc49 by default but it you change one change them all and rebuild.
#
# p5-ifeffit is configured using a Makefile.PL that is generated when ifeffit is built.
# since the paths to the compiler libraries contain compiler version information,
# if the compiler version changes then both ifeffit and p5-ifeffit need to be rebuilt
# so that the Makefile.PL in use contains the correct paths.
#
# if in doubt rebuild everything

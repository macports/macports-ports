# IMPORTANT BUILD NOTES
#
# p5-ifeffit is configured using a Makefile.PL that is generated when ifeffit is built.
# since the paths to the compiler libraries contain compiler version information,
# if the compiler version changes then both ifeffit and p5-ifeffit need to be rebuilt
# so that the Makefile.PL in use contains the correct paths.
#
# if in doubt rebuild everything

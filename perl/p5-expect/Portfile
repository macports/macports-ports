description         Perl version of the TCL "expect" tool
long_description    The Expect for Perl module was inspired more by the functionality \
                    the Tcl tool provides than any previous Expect-like tool such as \
                    Comm.pl or chat2.pl.  I've had some comments that people may not \
                    have heard of the original Tcl version of Expect, or where \
                    documentation (book form) on Expect may be obtained.

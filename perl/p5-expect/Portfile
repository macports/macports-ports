description      Perl version of the TCL "expect" tool
long_description \
    The Expect for Perl module was inspired more by the functionality \
    the Tcl tool provides than any previous Expect-like tool such as \
    Comm.pl or chat2.pl.  I've had some comments that people may not \
    have heard of the original Tcl version of Expect, or where \
    documentation (book form) on Expect may be obtained.

description           Moose minus the antlers
long_description      Moose is wonderful. \
                      Unfortunately, it's a little slow. Though significant \
                      progress has been made over the years, the compile \
                      time penalty is a non-starter for some applications. \
                      Mouse aims to alleviate this by providing a subset of \
                      Moose's functionality, faster. In particular, \"has\" \
                      in Moose is missing only a few expert-level features.

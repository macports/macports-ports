description		Generate Recursive-Descent Parsers
long_description	RecDescent incrementally generates top-down \
					recursive-descent text parsers from simple yacc-like \
					grammar specifications. It provides: \
					* Regular expressions or literal strings as \
					terminals (tokens), \
					* Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule, \
					* Repeated, optional and alternate subrules within \
					productions, \
					* Late-bound (run-time dispatched) subrules \
					* Full access to Perl within actions specified as \
					part of the grammar, \
					* Simple automated error reporting during parser \
					generation and parsing, \
					* The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject \
					particular productions during a parse, \
					* Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even \
					during a parse), \
					* Precompilation of parser objects, \
					* User-definable reduce-reduce conflict resolution \
					via "scoring" of matching productions. \
					See the file "RecDescent.pod" for excruciating \
					detail on all of this.

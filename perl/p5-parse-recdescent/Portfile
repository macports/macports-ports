description         Generate Recursive-Descent Parsers
long_description    RecDescent incrementally generates top-down \
                    recursive-descent text parsers from simple yacc-like \
                    grammar specifications. It provides: \
                    * Regular expressions or literal strings as \
                    terminals (tokens), \
                    * Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule, \
                    * Repeated, optional and alternate subrules within \
                    productions, \
                    * Late-bound (run-time dispatched) subrules \
                    * Full access to Perl within actions specified as \
                    part of the grammar, \
                    * Simple automated error reporting during parser \
                    generation and parsing, \
                    * The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject \
                    particular productions during a parse, \
                    * Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even \
                    during a parse), \
                    * Precompilation of parser objects, \
                    * User-definable reduce-reduce conflict resolution \
                    via "scoring" of matching productions. \
                    See the file "RecDescent.pod" for excruciating \
                    detail on all of this.

description           Add contextual fetches to DBI
long_description      It always struck me odd that DBI didn't take much \
                      advantage of Perl's context sensitivity. \
                      DBIx::ContextualFetch redefines some of the various \
                      fetch methods to fix this oversight. It also adds a \
                      few new methods for convenience (though not necessarily \
                      efficiency).

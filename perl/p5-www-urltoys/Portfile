description              WWW::URLToys - gather and download URLs from URLs

long_description         WWW::URLToys is a separation of the program URLToys \
                         into its core code (this module), and the programs \
                         that use it (urltoys and urltoysw). This module has \
                         been made available via CPAN to allow others to use \
                         URLToys commands on their Perl arrays, and to create \
                         interfaces for URLToys that far surpass those of the \
                         original creator.

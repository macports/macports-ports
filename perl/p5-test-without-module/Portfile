description         Test::Without::Module - Test fallback behaviour in absence of modules
long_description    This module allows you to deliberately hide modules from a program \
                    even though they are installed. This is mostly useful for testing \
                    modules that have a fallback when a certain dependency module \
                    is not installed.

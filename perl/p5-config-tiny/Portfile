description         Read/Write .ini style files with as little code as possible
long_description    "Config::Tiny" is a perl class to read and write .ini style \
                    configuration files with as little code as possible, reducing load \
                    time and memory overhead.  Most of the time it is accepted that Perl \
                    applications use a lot of memory and modules.  The "::Tiny" family of \
                    modules is specifically intended to provide an ultralight alternative \
                    to the standard modules.\
                    This module is primarily for reading human written files, and anything \
                    we write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments.  If you need \
                    something with more power move up to Config::Simple, Config::General \
                    or one of the many other "Config::" modules. To rephrase, Config::Tiny \
                    does not preserve your comments, whitespace, or the order of your \
                    config file.

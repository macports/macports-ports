description         Retrieve list of filesystems and their properties
long_description    Sys::Filesystem is intended to be a \
                    portable interface to list and query filesystem names and their \
                    properties. At the time of writing there were only Solaris and \
                    Win32 modules available on CPAN to perform this kind of \
                    operation. This module hopes to provide a consistant API to list \
                    all, mounted, unmounted and special filesystems on a system, and \
                    query as many properties as possible with common aliases wherever \
                    possible.

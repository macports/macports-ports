description         Pretty printing of data structures
long_description    This module provides a single function called dump() \
                    that takes a list of values as its argument and produces \
                    a string as its result. The string contains Perl code \
                    that, when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original \
                    arguments. The string is formatted for easy reading. If \
                    dump() is called in a void context, then the dump is \
                    printed on STDERR instead of being returned.

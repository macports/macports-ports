description			Implementation of a "Singleton" class
long_description \
	This is the Class::Singleton module. A Singleton describes an object \
	class that can have only one instance in any system. An example of a \
	Singleton might be a print spooler or system registry. This module \
	implements a Singleton class from which other classes can be derived. \
	By itself, the Class::Singleton module does very little other than \
	manage the instantiation of a single object.  In deriving a class from \
	Class::Singleton, your module will inherit the Singleton instantiation \
	method and can implement whatever specific functionality is required.

description           two Apple iTMS/iTunes key descrambling algorithms
long_description      The first algorithm appears to have only cursory \
                      resemblance to Bruce Schneier's blowfish and twofish \
                      algorithms in that it too has a table-based decoder. \
                      The second algorithm is more standard encryption using \
                      S-box type permutations and lookup tables, and might \
                      have started out something like Twofish or Blowfish.

description         Try::Tiny - minimal try/catch with proper preservation of $@
long_description    The main focus of this module is to provide simple and reliable error \
                    handling for those having a hard time installing TryCatch, but who \
                    still want to write correct \"eval\" blocks without 5 lines of \
                    boilerplate each time.  It\'s designed to work as correctly as \
                    possible in light of the various pathological edge cases and to be \
                    compatible with any style of error values (simple strings, \
                    references, objects, overloaded objects, etc).

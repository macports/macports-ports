description		Text utilities for use with GD
long_description	This package provides three modules that make it \
					possible to work with internal GD fonts as well as \
					TrueType fonts, without having to worry about \
					different interface functions to call.  Apart from \
					an abstract interface to all font types and strings \
					for GD, this library also provides some utility in \
					aligning and wrapping your string.

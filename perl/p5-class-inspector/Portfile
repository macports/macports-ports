description         Get information about a class and its structure
long_description    Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a \
                    loaded class. Most or all of this information can be \
                    found in other ways, but they aren't always very \
                    friendly, and usually involve a relatively high level of \
                    Perl wizardry, or strange and unusual looking code. \
                    Class::Inspector attempts to provide an easier, more \
                    friendly interface to this information.

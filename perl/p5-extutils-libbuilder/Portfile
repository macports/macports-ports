description         help build perl modules with self-contained C libraries

long_description    Some Perl modules need to ship C libraries together with their Perl    \
                    code. Although there are mechanisms to compile and link (or glue) C    \
                    code in your Perl programs, there isn't a clear method to compile      \
                    standard, self-contained C libraries. This module's main goal is to    \
                    help in that task.

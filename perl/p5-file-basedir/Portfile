long_description    This module can be used to find directories and files as             \
                    specified by the Freedesktop.org Base Directory Specification.       \
                    This specifications gives a mechanism to locate directories for      \
                    configuration, application data and cache data. It is suggested      \
                    that desktop applications for e.g. the Gnome, KDE or Xfce platforms  \
                    follow this layout. However, the same layout can just as well be     \
                    used for non-GUI applications.

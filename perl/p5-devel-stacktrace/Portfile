description         Stack trace and stack trace frame objects
long_description    The Devel::StackTrace module contains two classes, \
                    Devel::StackTrace and Devel::StackTraceFrame. The \
                    goal of this object is to encapsulate the \
                    information that can found through using the \
                    caller() function, as well as providing a simple \
                    interface to this data.

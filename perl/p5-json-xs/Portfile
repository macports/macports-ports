description         JSON serialising/deserialising, done correctly and fast
long_description    This module converts Perl data structures to JSON and \
                    vice versa. Its primary goal is to be *correct* and its \
                    secondary goal is to be *fast*.  To reach the latter goal \
                    it was written in C.

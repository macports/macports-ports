description             This module reads a file backwards line by line.

long_description        It is simple to use, memory efficient and fast. \
			It supports both an object and a tied handle interface. \
										\
			It is intended for processing log and other similar text \
			files which typically have their newest entries appended \
			to them. By default files are assumed to be plain text and \
			have a line ending appropriate to the OS. But you can set \
			the input record separator string on a per file basis.

description         This module reads a file backwards line by line.

long_description    It is simple to use, memory efficient and fast. \
                    It supports both an object and a tied handle interface. \
                                            \
                    It is intended for processing log and other similar text \
                    files which typically have their newest entries appended \
                    to them. By default files are assumed to be plain text and \
                    have a line ending appropriate to the OS. But you can set \
                    the input record separator string on a per file basis.

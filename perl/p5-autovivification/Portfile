description         Lexically disable autovivification

long_description    When an undefined variable is dereferenced, it gets silently upgraded to \
                    an array or hash reference (depending of the type of the dereferencing). \
                    This behaviour is called *autovivification* and usually does what you    \
                    mean (e.g. when you store a value) but it may be unnatural or surprising \
                    because your variables gets populated behind your back. This is          \
                    especially true when several levels of dereferencing are involved, in    \
                    which case all levels are vivified up to the last, or when it happens in \
                    intuitively read-only constructs like 'exists'.                          \
                                                                                             \
                    This pragma lets you disable autovivification for some constructs and    \
                    optionally throws a warning or an error when it would have happened.

long_description \
                GnuCash is a personal and small-business \
                financial-accounting software, freely licensed under the \
                GNU GPL.  Designed to be easy to use, yet powerful and \
                flexible, GnuCash allows you to track bank accounts, \
                stocks, income and expenses. As quick and intuitive to \
                use as a checkbook register, it is based on professional \
                accounting principles to ensure balanced books and \
                accurate reports. \
                This package contains (1) the user manual and (2) the \
                Tutorial And Concepts Guide.  Both are available through \
                yelp, the gnome help browser, and an HTML copy is \
                installed in ${prefix}/share/doc/gnucash.

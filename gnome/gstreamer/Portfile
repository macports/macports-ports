PortSystem 1.0

name		gstreamer
version		0.10.19
description	A framework for streaming media.
long_description	This is GStreamer, a framework for streaming media. \
			The fundamental design comes from the video pipeline at \
			Oregon Graduate Institute, as well as some ideas from \
			DirectMedia.  It's based on plug-ins that will provide \
			the various codec and other functionality. The \
			interface hopefully is generic enough for various \
			companies (ahem, Apple) to release binary codecs for \
			Linux, until such time as they get a clue and \
			release the source.

description		Sodipodi is a vector-based drawing program.
long_description	Sodipodi is a vector-based drawing program, like \
					CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator from the proprietary \
					software world, and Sketch or Karbon14 from the free \
					software world. It is free software, distributed under \
					the terms of the Gnu General Public License, Version 2. \
					Sodipodi uses W3C SVG as its native file format. It is \
					therefore a very useful tool for web designers. It has \
					a relatively modern display engine, giving you finely \
					antialiased display, alpha transparencies, vector fonts \
					and so on. Sodipodi is written in C, using the Gtk+ \
					toolkit and optionally some Gnome libraries. Sodipodi \
					works under most versions of Unix and Windows.

long_description	\
	Sodipodi is a vector-based drawing program, like \
	CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator from the proprietary \
	software world, and Sketch or Karbon14 from the free \
	software world. It is free software, distributed under \
	the terms of the Gnu General Public License, Version 2. \
	Sodipodi uses W3C SVG as its native file format. It is \
	therefore a very useful tool for web designers. It has \
	a relatively modern display engine, giving you finely \
	antialiased display, alpha transparencies, vector fonts \
	and so on. Sodipodi is written in C, using the Gtk+ \
	toolkit and optionally some Gnome libraries. Sodipodi \
	works under most versions of Unix and Windows.

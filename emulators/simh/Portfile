long_description	\
		The Computer History Simulation Project is a loose	\
		Internet-based collective of people interested in	\
		restoring historically significant computer hardware	\
		and software systems by simulation. The goal of the	\
		project is to create highly portable system simulators	\
		and to publish them as freeware on the Internet,	\
		with freely available copies of significant or		\
		representative software.

SheepShaver idiosyncracies:

SheepShaver is an older program that has been brought along through the years. There are a few idiosyncracies. It remains under active development. See <http://sheepshaver.cebix.net/> for more details.

There is considerable available information regarding how to set up SheepShaver, for example <https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/sheepshaver_mac_os_x_setup>.

To use SheepShaver, you first configure the emulator options with the SheepShaverGUI application. Once you have it configured the way you want, you can launch SheepShaver directly from the SheepShaverGUI application. For future uses however, you don't need to open the SheepShaverGUI application; you can launch the emulator directly with the SheepShaver application.

Full screen mode appears to work very well. To toggle between full screen mode and windowed mode, use control-return in the emulator. You can change screen dimensions and colour depth while in full screen mode to suit your needs, although some of the video modes and colour depths have obvious artifacts.

It is possible to build the emulator in an x86_64 (64bit) configuration on suitable hardware. At present to do this you will need to manually edit the Portfile to change supported_arches to x86_64.

On a 64 bit build of SheepShaver, I have noted some idiosyncracies using the mouse in the menu bar region when in full screen mode. I don't know of a workaround for this, other than to switch to a windowed mode (control-return). The 32bit builds don't appear to have this issue, and are currently the default.

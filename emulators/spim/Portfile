description     an assembly language MIPS R2000/R3000 simulator
long_description \
	SPIM S20 is a software simulator that runs assembly language programs for \
	the MIPS R2000/R3000 RISC computers.  SPIM can read and immediately run \
	files containing assembly language statements.  SPIM is a self-contained \
	system for running these programs and contains a debugger and interface to \
	the operating system. \
	\
	SPIM implements almost the entire MIPS assembler-extended instruction set \
	for the R2000/R3000 (I've omitted some the complex floating point comparisons \
	and details of the memory system page tables).  The MIPS architecture has \
	evolved considerably since then (in particular the 64 bit extensions), which \
	means that SPIM will not run programs compiled for recent MIPS or SGI \
	processors.

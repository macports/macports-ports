# tested on 10.4 PPC, 10.4 Intel, 10.5 Intel, 10.6 with LibCxx upgrade, 10.7, 10.11
# hatari command line builds on all systems
# hatari python UI not needed with macOS GUI or command line versions - has unspecified python version so not included
# hatari macOS GUI builds on >= 10.6 as NSWindowDelegate is used and is only 10.6 onwards
# macOS GUI does not build with gcc* or llvm-gcc-4.2
# winuae works on all with gcc flag modification below. 
# SDL2 works on 10.6, 10.7 and 10.11, and likely all in between, but not 10.5

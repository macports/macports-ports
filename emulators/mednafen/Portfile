description         Super-fast and super-compatible emulator for many video game systems
long_description    Medfafen is a portable (utilizing OpenGL and SDL) \
    argument-driven multi-system emulator with many \
    advanced features. The Atari Lynx, GameBoy, GameBoy \
    Colour, GameBoy Advance, NES, PC Engine (TurboGrafx 16) \
    and SuperGrafx are emulated. Mednafen has the ability \
    to remap hotkey functions and virtual system inputs \
    to a keyboard, a joystick, or both simultaneously. \
    Save states are supported, as is real-time game \
    rewinding.

notes "
Mednafen works by executing the ROM file of a game console you'd like to\
emulate. Note that no ROM files are included with Mednafen, so first you must\
obtain the game console ROM file of your choice, by legal means of course.

Supported ROM file formats are listed in section 'File Formats/Expansion\
Hardware' in the Mednafen documenation at ${prefix}/share/doc/${name}. Once\
you've obtained a supported type of game console ROM file, start the Mednafen\
command-line executable and use the ROM filename (including path) as an\
argument. See the documentation for more options.

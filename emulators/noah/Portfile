description             Linux ABI implementation for OSX

homepage                http://github.com/linux-noah/noah

long_description        Noah is a Darwin subsystem for Linux, or \"Bash on Ubuntu on Mac OS X\". Noah is implemented as a hypervisor that traps linux system calls and translates them into Darwin's system calls. Noah also has an interpreter of ELF files so that binary executables of Linux run directly and flawlessly without any modifications. \
\
                        I.e. it's effectively an OSX Linux Execution Flavour, similar to that of FreeBSD Linuxolator, aka Linux Emulation, aka Linux ABI. \
\
                        In other words, it's the exact reverse of the Linux Darling project: https://github.com/darlinghq.

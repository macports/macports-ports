description         Bomber is a single player arcade game. The player is invading \
                    various cities in a plane that is decreasing in height.
long_description    ${description} The goal of the game is to destroy all the \
                    buildings and advance to the next level. Each level gets a bit \
                    harder by increasing the speed of the plane and the height of \
                    the buildings.

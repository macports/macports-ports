description         Kapman is a clone of the well known game Pac-Man.
long_description    ${description} You must run through the maze to eat all pills \
                    without being captured by a ghost. By eating an energizer, \
                    Kapman gets the ability to eat ghosts for a few seconds. When a \
                    stage is cleared of pills and energizer the player is taken to \
                    the next stage with slightly increased game speed.

description         KDE Image Plugin Interface
long_description    KIPI is an effort to develop a common plugin structure for \
                    Digikam, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and GwenView. Its aim is to \
                    share image plugins among graphic applications. Kipi is \
                    based on the old digiKam plugins implementation.

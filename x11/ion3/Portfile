description       A tiling window manager for keyboard users
long_description  Ion is a tiling tabbed window manager designed \
                  with keyboard users in mind. It tries to address \
                  the navigation problem by dividing the screen into \
		  mutually non-overlapping frames. As in PWM, the \
		  frames may have multiple clients attached.

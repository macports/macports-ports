description      The Three-D Athena Toolkit
long_description \
    This release of Xaw3d is based on X.Org's X11R6.3 Athena \
    toolkit, with bits and pieces thrown in from other sources. \
    It is intended to be a general-purpose replacement for the \
    Athena (Xaw) toolkit. In general, you should be able to link \
    almost any Athena-based application to this Xaw3d Athena \
    toolkit, for a three-dimensional appearance on most of the \
    widgets. On systems with shared libraries, you might be able \
    replace your shared libXaw.* with libXaw3d.* to obtain the \
    appearance without even relinking, but the odds of this \
    working is slim, and not recommended.

long_description \
   xev creates a window and then asks the X server to send it events \
   whenever anything happens to the window (such as it being moved, resized, \
   typed in, clicked in, etc.).  You can also attach it to an existing \
   window.  It is useful for seeing what causes events to occur and to \
   display the information that they contain.  It is essentially a debugging \
   and development tool, and should not be needed in normal usage.

long_description \
    XCircuit is a program for drawing publishable-quality \
    electrical circuit schematic diagrams and related figures, \
    and produce circuit netlists through schematic capture. \
    XCircuit regards circuits as inherently hierarchical, and \
    writes both hierarchical PostScript output and \
    hierarchical SPICE netlists. Circuit components are saved \
    in and retrieved from libraries which are fully editable. \
    XCircuit does not separate artistic expression from \
    circuit drawing\; it maintains flexiblity in style without \
    compromising the power of schematic capture.

long_description	XGlobe displays the earth as seen from space on your X desktop, similar \
			to xearth by Kirk Lauritz Johnson. \
			The image of the globe is updated at regular intervals. \
			XGlobe uses a world map image which is mapped to the globe. \
			With a good map this can look very nice. \
			It is possible to mark locations on the globe. \
			This port includes the work done by Mark Espie from OpenBSD, that has not \
			yet be included upstream. Also there is a markerfile with the positions of \
			the OpenDarwin developers.

notes "xglobe starts in the X11 root window, so enable the full screen menu\
in Apple's X11 preferences menu and then use Command-Shift-A to\
enter and exit full screen mode to view xglobe in the X11 root window."

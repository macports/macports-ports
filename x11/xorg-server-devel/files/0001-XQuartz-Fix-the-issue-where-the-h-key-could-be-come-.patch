Subject: [PATCH 1/4] XQuartz: Fix the issue where the h key could be come
 "stuck" after hiding XQuartz with cmd-h

The issue was that we set a flag to ignore the k key's up event when sent
the cmd-h down event, but because the cmd-h keycode hides XQuartz, we
became !_x_active by the time the event is delivered which caused us to
go down a differnet codepath rather than getting a chance to ignore it.
We then incorrectly ignored the next h up key.

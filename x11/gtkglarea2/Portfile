long_description        Just as GTK+ is built on top of GDK, GtkGLArea is built on top of \
                        gdkgl which is basically wrapper around GLX functions. The widget \
                        itself is very similar to GtkDrawinigArea widget and adds only three \
                        extra functions. Lower level gdkgl functions make it easy to render \
                        on any widget that has OpenGL capable visual, rendering to off-screen \
                        pixmaps is also supported.

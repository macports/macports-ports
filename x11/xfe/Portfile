    X File Explorer (Xfe) is a filemanager for X. It is based on the popular \
    X Win Commander, which is discontinued. Xfe is desktop independent and \
    is written with the C++ Fox Toolkit. It has Windows Commander or \
    MS-Explorer look and is very fast and simple. The main features are: \
    file associations, mount/umount devices, directory tree for quick cd, \
    change file attributes, auto save registry, compressed archives \

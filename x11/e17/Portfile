description             Enlightenment windowmanager DR17

long_description        Development Release 17 of the Enlightenment window \
                        manager represents an evolution into the next generation \
                        of desktop environments: the desktop shell. DR17 will \
                        provide integration between files and your environment in a \
                        seamless manner while encompassing a graphically rich and \
                        flexible architecture. It will not compete with GNOME or KDE, \
                        but be a completely new way of visualizing your desktop, \
                        based around the EFL which was built from the ground up \
                        for this task.

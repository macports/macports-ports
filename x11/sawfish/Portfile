description	A lisp-based extensible window manager

long_description Sawfish is an extensible window manager using a \
                 lisp-based scripting language -- all window \
                 decorations are configurable and all user-interface \
                 policy is controlled through the extension \
                 language. This is no layer on top of twm, but a \
                 wholly new architecture.

To use the sawfish window manager, you must set it to run at X11 startup in
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc or ~/.xinitrc.  To change the window manager from the
default quartz window manager to sawfish, change:

exec quartz-wm

to

exec sawfish

long_description \
	Written by Alexander Iliev, this plugin displays the current keyboard \
    layout, and refreshes when layout changes. Also the layout can be switched \
    by simply clicking on the plugin. The new version can display the layout as \
    text label and also as an image of the corresponding country's flag. If the \
    flag image is unavailable then the plugin falls back to displaying text label \
    for that layout. \
	This plugin is used along with the XKB extension. For now the keyboard \
    layouts cannot be configured from the plugin itself, they should be set in \
    the XF86Config file or some other way (e.g. setxkbmap).

description         The Large Time-Frequency Analysis Toolbox

long_description    {*}${description} (LTFAT) is a Matlab/Octave toolbox for working with \
                    time-frequency analysis, wavelets and signal processing. It is \
                    intended both as an educational and a computational tool. The toolbox \
                    provides a large number of linear transforms including Gabor and \
                    wavelet transforms along with routines for constructing windows \
                    (filter prototypes) and routines for manipulating coefficients.

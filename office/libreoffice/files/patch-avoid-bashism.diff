Subject: [PATCH] Avoid bash'ism (comment in line continuation)

bash appears to remove comments only up to the next line-continuation
backslash/newline pair, while SUS mandates that the "<backslash> and <newline>
shall be removed before splitting the input into tokens", and at least zsh 5.8
follows that interpretation and thus complained about a `then` not followed by a
`fi`

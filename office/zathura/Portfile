long_description \
    Zathura is a highly customizable and functional document viewer. It     \
    provides a minimalistic and space saving interface as well as an easy   \
    usage that mainly focuses on keyboard interaction. Zathura uses a plug- \
    in based system for supported document types. Zathura makes it possible \
    to completely view and navigate through different documents without a   \
    mouse. It supports bi-directional SyncTeX, as well as quickmarks, book- \
    marks and automatic document reloading. Almost everything in Zathura is \
    customizable.

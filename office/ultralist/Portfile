description         Simple task management for tech folks.

long_description    Ultralist is a task management system for technical \
                    people. It is a command-line component that is very fast \
                    and stays out of the way.  Ultralist is based off of the \
                    Getting Things Done system. It has a concept of due \
                    dates, projects, and contexts.

# This prevents configure from trying to use a program to fetch dependencies.

# * patch-stop-fetch-check.diff dikes out a test that will prevent us
#   from disabling fetch. Otherwise FETCH=no will fail and we'll need to
#   depend on curl or wget.
# * patch-makefile.diff is a kludge to put documentation files into
#   share/doc/opam-installer -- without this, they'd end up in
#   doc/opam-installer, and there is no /opt/local/doc.
# * patch-fix-opamarg.diff fixes a temporary problem with the
#    2.0.2 distribution and should be removed once a later version is
#    available.

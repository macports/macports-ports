description         Parser combinators built for speed and memory-efficiency
long_description    Angstrom is a parser-combinator library that makes it easy \
                    to write efficient, expressive, and reusable parsers \
                    suitable for high-performance applications. It exposes \
                    monadic and applicative interfaces for composition, and \
                    supports incremental input through buffered and unbuffered \
                    interfaces. Both interfaces give the user total control \
                    over the blocking behavior of their application, with the \
                    unbuffered interface enabling zero-copy IO. Parsers are \
                    backtracking by default and support unbounded lookahead.

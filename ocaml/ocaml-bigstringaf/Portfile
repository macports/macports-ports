description         Bigstring intrinsics and fast blits based on memcpy/memmove
long_description    The OCaml compiler has a bunch of intrinsics for \
                    Bigstrings, but they're not widely-known, sometimes \
                    misused, and so programs that use Bigstrings are slower \
                    than they have to be. And even if a library got that part \
                    right and exposed the intrinsics properly, the compiler \
                    doesn't have any fast blits between Bigstrings and other \
                    string-like types. \
                    \
                    So here they are. Go crazy.

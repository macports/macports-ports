description             C64 music player for the Mac

long_description        SIDPLAY is a Commodore 64 music player. It emulates \
                        the sound chip and other internals of the Commodore 64 \
                        home computer to play back music that was originally \
                        written on it. The sound chip of the C64 is called the \
                        "Sound Interface Device" or SID, and therefore this \
                        music is known as SID music. The SID chip is basically \
                        a three voice synthesizer on a chip. The unusual \
                        combination of digital and analogue circuitry is the \
                        reason for its distinctive sound.

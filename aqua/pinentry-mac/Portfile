    notes   "
             If you previously didn't have pinentry or gpg-agent installed \
             and ${name} has been installed as a dependency of gpg-agent, \
             you don't need to do anything to use ${name}.

             If you want to switch to the GTK2, ncurses or Qt4 based pinentry \
             program, please install pinentry with the correct use flags and \
             follow the instructions below substituting the ${name} program \
             path with ${prefix}/bin/pinentry.


             If you previously had pinentry and gpg-agent installed and would \
             like to switch to ${name}, you will have to set \
             it as your pinentry program in \$HOME/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf.

             Add the following line to the mentioned file:
             pinentry-program ${applications_dir}/${name}.app/Contents/MacOS/${name}


             Be sure to comment previous \"pinentry-program\" lines, for example:

             pinentry-program SAMPLE

             becomes

             #pinentry-program SAMPLE


             Afterwards, run
             killall -HUP gpg-agent

             or simply log out and back in again.

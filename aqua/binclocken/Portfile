description     useless floating binary LED clock for your desktop
long_description \
    I was given a ThinkGeek binary clock by a friend (in a \
    not-so-transparent attempt to force me to learn binary \
    math). It sucks. It runs fast, very fast, gaining about \
    5 minutes per day, making it totally useless. So this is \
    my revenge on the world. Plus, I was drunk when I wrote it.

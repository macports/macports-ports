description		Program for creating application wrappers around scripts.
long_description	Platypus is a program for creating application \
			wrappers around scripts, i.e. creating MacOS X \
			applications that execute a script they are bundled \
			with. Scripts can thus be run transparently from the \
			graphical window environment without having to \
			resort to using the command line interface. It \
			supports drag and drop on created apps, running as \
			root using Authentication Manager and more.

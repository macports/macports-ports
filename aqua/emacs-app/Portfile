description	The GNU Emacs text editor (Cocoa version)

long_description	GNU Emacs is a self-documenting, customizable,      \
	extensible real-time display editor. This is a port of the latest   \
	GNU Emacs source to the OpenStep (or NeXTstep) APIs, as implemented \
	by Cocoa on OS X. It differs from Carbon ports of GNU Emacs in that \
	it makes a more concerted attempt from the ground up to follow OS X \
	desktop and UI conventions.

# Note that this distribution can support GNUstep as well, but that
# configuration is untested at this time.

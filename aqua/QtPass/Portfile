description \
    QtPass is a multi-platform GUI for pass, the standard unix password manager.
long_description \
    QtPass is part of the pass ecosystem. This means you are not stuck with \
    QtPass, you can use the same password store with many clients. \
    \
    Contrary to many Free, Libre and OpenSource password managers, pass and by \
    extension QtPass are not bound to one user or device. Since we are based on \
    GnuPG we have multi-key, multi recipient encryption out of the box. The use \
    of external encryption devices like OpenPGP or x509/CMS based smartcards or \
    USB tokens and per-folder ACL makes it easy to grant or take away privileges \
    from users.

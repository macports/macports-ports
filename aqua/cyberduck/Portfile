description		Cyberduck is an open source SFTP and FTP browser
long_description	Cyberduck is an open source SFTP (SSH Secure File \
					Transfer) and FTP browser licenced under the GPL. It \
					has been built from the ground up with usability in \
					mind, having the same consistent graphical user \
					interface for both SFTP and FTP browsing. Multiple \
					connections are supported. Drag and drop is \
					supported consequently for transferring files \
					between server and client. A transfer queue keeps \
					track of the pending file transfers. A simple \
					bookmark manager ensures manageability. Core system \
					technologies such as the Keychain and Rendezvous are \
					supported. Cyberduck has been translated into \
					numerous languages including Japanese, Chinese, \
					Korean, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish \
					and Dutch.

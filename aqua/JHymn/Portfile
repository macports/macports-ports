description         iTMS DRM removal utility
long_description    The purpose of JHymn is to allow you to exercise your \
                    fair-use rights under copyright law. It allows you to free \
                    your iTunes Music Store (protected AAC/m4p) purchases from \
                    their DRM restrictions with no sound quality loss. These \
                    songs can then be played outside of the iTunes \
                    environment, even on operating systems not supported by \
                    iTunes.

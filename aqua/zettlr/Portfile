description         A Markdown Editor for the 21st century.

long_description    Zettlr is a Markdown Editor for the 21st century. \
                    Zettlr supercharges your writing experience and makes no \
                    compromises.  It supports standard Markdown and does not \
                    need any special handling.  Just pull in your existing \
                    notes, Zettelkasten, and paper projects and start working \
                    on them immediately.  Zettlr uses a WYSIWYM (What You See \
                    Is What You Mean) approach and renders certain elements \
                    such as links directly for your convenience.  Zettlr is \
                    the first Markdown editor directly aimed at writing \
                    professionally. Whether you are a college student, a \
                    researcher, a journalist or an author -- Zettlr has the \
                    right tools for you.

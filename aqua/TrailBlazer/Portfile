description	TrailBlazer is a browser with an experimental history
long_description	TrailBlazer solves the problem of getting back to a  \
			web page you've been to before, but didn't have the \
			forethought to  bookmark. The current solutions \
			provided by most web browsers, their  history menu, is \
			just a list of titles and web addresses which aren't \
			memorable enough to be useful. \
			The actual solution used by most people, is to \
			retrace  their own steps through different links until \
			they find they page  they are looking for. Our \
			software solution provides the user with  a graphical \
			representation of the steps they took from page to \
			page,  such that they can simply click to their final \
			destination page. \
			TrailBlazer was developed by MacWarriors and  released \
			at the University of Illinois' Engineering  Open House \
			2004.

description		A Mac OS X SFTP, SCP and SSH Frontend.
long_description	Fugu is a graphical frontend to the commandline \
			Secure File Transfer application (SFTP). SFTP is \
			similar to FTP, but unlike FTP, the entire session \
			is encrypted, meaning no passwords are sent in \
			cleartext form, and is thus much less vulnerable to \
			third-party interception.

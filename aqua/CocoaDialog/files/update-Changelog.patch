+NOTE:
+Technically, yes, there are 3.0.0-betaX releases floating out there in the world that start with the major version 3.
+
+Realistically, however, these releases never made their way into any sort of "official stable release" and were truly just alpha level experimentation. The code, features, and options were based entirely on cocoadialog 2 and do not reflect cocoadialog 3 in any way.
+
+So for brevity and to avoid a "What happened to cocoadialog 3?" fiasco, we're simply going to ignore these betas and treat them like a couple minor version bump releases of cocoadialog 2 (e.g. 2.3.x, where "x" represents the "beta version").

description         application that displays logfiles on your desktop

long_description    This is a little application that displays logfiles on \
                    your desktop. Really useful if you have to monitor \
                    servers or you just want to keep an eye on what's going \
                    on on your machine. In its standard configuration it \
                    displays entries from any number of logfiles interleaved \
                    in a single window. Have a look at some screenshots. \
                    MkConsole is smart enough to close and reopen files \
                    every now and then to deal with rotating files and it \
                    transparently works around stale NFS handles which often \
                    exist after your Mac wakes up from sleep and tries to \
                    read from a logfile mounted via NFS. If you don't mind \
                    hacking the user defaults (rather than using the \
                    preferences panel) you can also configure multiple \
                    windows with multiple logfiles each.

description     XRG is an open source system monitor for Mac OS X.
long_description \
    XRG allows you to monitor CPU activity, memory \
    usage, battery status, machine temperature, network \
    activity, disk I/O, current weather, and stock \
    market data. The goal of XRG is to be a functional \
    system monitor that has a clean and flexible \
    interface, so it doesn't intrude on the rest of your \
    Mac experience. XRG is designed to take as little \
    CPU time as possible while still showing detailed \
    graphs on system usage.

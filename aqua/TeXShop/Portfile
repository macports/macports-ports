description     TeX previewer for Mac OS X
long_description   \
    TeXShop is a TeX previewer for Mac OS X, written in Cocoa.  \
    Since pdf is a native file format on OS X, TeXShop uses     \
    "pdftex" and "pdflatex" rather than "tex" and "latex" to    \
    typeset, these programs in the standard teTeX distribution  \
    of TeX produce pdf output instead of dvi output.

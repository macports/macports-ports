description             Access to native shared libraries with pure Java code

long_description        Java Native Access provides Java programs easy \
                        access to native shared libraries (DLLs on Windows) \
                        without writing anything but Java code - no JNI or \
                        native code is required.  This functionality is \
                        comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's \
                        ctypes.  Access is dynamic at runtime without code \
                        generation.  JNA's design aims to provide native \
                        access in a natural way with a minimum of effort.  \
                        No boilerplate or generated code is required.  While \
                        some attention is paid to performance, correctness \
                        and ease of use take priority.

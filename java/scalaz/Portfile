description	General utility library that extends the Scala core API
long_description \
	Scalaz (Scar-lah-zed) is a library written in the Scala Programming \
	Language.  One mandate of the library is to depend only on the core \
	Scala API and the core Java 2 Standard Edition API.  The intention \
	of Scalaz is to include general functions that are not currently \
	available in the core Scala API.  Scalaz is released under a BSD \
	open source licence making it compatible with the licence of the \
	Scala project.

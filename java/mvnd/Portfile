long_description mvnd aims at providing faster Maven builds using techniques known from Gradle and Takari.\
                \n\
                \n* mvnd embeds Maven (so there is no need to install Maven separately).\
                \n* The actual builds happen inside a long living background process, a.k.a. daemon.\
                \n* One daemon instance can serve multiple consecutive requests from the mvnd client.\
                \n* The mvnd client is a native executable built using GraalVM.\
                It starts faster and uses less memory compared to starting a traditional JVM.\
                \n* Multiple daemons can be spawned in parallel if there is no idle daemon to serve a build request.\
                \n* The JVM for running the actual builds does not need to get started anew for each build.\
                \n* The classloaders holding classes of Maven plugins are cached over multiple builds.\
                The plugin jars are thus read and parsed just once. SNAPSHOT versions of Maven plugins are not cached.\
                \n* The native code produced by the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler inside the JVM is kept too.\
                Compared to stock Maven, less time is spent by the JIT compilation.\
                During the repeated builds the JIT-optimized code is available immediately.\
                This applies not only to the code coming from Maven plugins and Maven Core,\
                but also to all code coming from the JDK itself.

description     A java-based build and project management environment.
long_description \
                Maven is a Java project management and project \
                comprehension tool.  Maven is based on the \
                concept of a project object model (POM) in that \
                all the artifacts produced by Maven are a result \
                of consulting a well defined model for your \
                project.Builds, documentation, source metrics, \
                and source cross-references are all controlled by \
                your POM.  Maven 3 aims to ensure backward \
                compatibility with Maven 2, improve usability, \
                increase performance, allow safe embedding, and \
                pave the way to implement many highly demanded \
                features.

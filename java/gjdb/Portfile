long_description    GJDB is a modification of JDB, a debugger that comes with \
                    the public JDK (Java Development Kit) from Sun.  Unlike \
                    Sun's version, it also allows you to debug programs that \
                    take input from the terminal.  The expression language \
                    has been extended to include much more of the language \
                    (including numerous features missing from jdb, such as \
                    array allocation, initialized array allocation, the \
                    .super operator, less fussy overload resolution, and \
                    numerous binary numeric and logical operations).

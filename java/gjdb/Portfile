long_description    GJDB is a modification of JDB, a debugger that comes \
                    with the public JDK (Java Development Kit) from Sun. \
                    Unlike Sun's version, it also allows you to debug \
                    programs that take input from the terminal. The \
                    expression language has been extended to include \
                    much more of the language (including numerous \
                    features missing from jdb, such as array \
                    allocation, initialized array allocation, the \
                    .super operator, less fussy overload resolution, \
                    and numerous binary numeric and logical \
                    operations).

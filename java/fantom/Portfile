description         The Language Formerly Known as Fan.
long_description    Fantom is designed as a practical programming \
                    language to make it easy and fun to get real work \
                    done. It is not an academic language to explore \
                    bleeding edge theories, but based on solid real \
                    world experience. During its design we set out to \
                    solve what we perceived were some real problems \
                    with Java and C#.

description     Cross-platform Java executable wrapper
long_description \
                Launch4j is a cross-platform tool for wrapping Java \
                applications distributed as jars in lightweight Windows \
                native executables. The executable can be configured to \
                search for a certain JRE version or use a bundled one, \
                and it's possible to set runtime options, like the \
                initial/max heap size. The wrapper also provides better \
                user experience through an application icon, a native \
                pre-JRE splash screen, a custom process name, and a Java \
                download page in case the appropriate JRE cannot be found.

# A binary copy of windres (from GNU bintools) is included; it links to
# /opt/local/lib/libgcc/libggc_s.1.dylib for some reason. Upstream only has the
# binary, not source, so we can't rebuild it. Instead we relink to our own
# library in case the prefix is not the default.

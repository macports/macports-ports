description     Cross-platform Java executable wrapper
long_description \
				Launch4j is a cross-platform tool for wrapping Java \
				applications distributed as jars in lightweight Windows \
				native executables. The executable can be configured to \
				search for a certain JRE version or use a bundled one, \
				and it's possible to set runtime options, like the \
				initial/max heap size. The wrapper also provides better \
				user experience through an application icon, a native \
				pre-JRE splash screen, a custom process name, and a Java \
				download page in case the appropriate JRE cannot be found.

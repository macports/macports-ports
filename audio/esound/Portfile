long_description EsounD, the Enlightened Sound Daemon, is a server \
		process that mixes several audio streams for playback \
		by a single audio device.  For example, if you're \
		listening to music on a CD and you receive a \
		sound-related event from ICQ, the two applications won't \
		have to jockey for the use of your sound card.

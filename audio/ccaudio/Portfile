description			Library and software for manipulating audio data
long_description \
	The GNU ccAudio library is a portable C++ class framework that's useful \
	for developing applications that must process audio.  This library \
	provides a class framework for accessing audio segments from various \
	audio file formats (.au, .wav, etc) and for creation of audio frame \
	buffers that are then passed to audio devices and/or DSP processing \
	systems such as telephony cards.

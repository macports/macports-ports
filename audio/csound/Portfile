description         A language that is used to describe sound synthesizers.

long_description    Csound is a computer programming language for dealing with \
                    sound. It is called Csound because it is written in the C \
                    programming language, as opposed to some of its \
                    predecessors. Csound was written at MIT by Barry Vercoe, \
                    based on an earlier language called Music360.

description      A streaming media server
long_description \
    Icecast is a streaming media (audio/video) server which currently \
    supports Ogg (Vorbis and Theora), Opus, WebM and MP3 streams. It \
    can be used to create an Internet radio station or a privately \
    running jukebox and many things in between. It is very versatile \
    in that new formats can be added relatively easily and supports \
    open standards for communication and interaction.

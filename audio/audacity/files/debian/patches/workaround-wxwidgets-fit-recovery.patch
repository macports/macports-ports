Description: Workaround for wx bug causing layout problems in recovery dialog
 Workaround for a bug in wxWidgets 3.0 that causes the Fit()
 function to fail in certain desktop environments (gnome, xfce)
 before the first window of the same style class is shown on
 screen (http://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/16440). As a workaround,
 call Fit() and other methods that depend on its results again
 *after* we know that the window has been shown. While the bug
 may affect other calls to Fit() on a low level, the workaround
 is necessary only for the recovery dialog, which is particularly
 vulnerable because:
 1. It is shown very, very early in the program execution and
 therefore very likely to be the first dialog of its style class
 shown on screen.
 2. It doesn't have scrollbars or flexible-size controls that
 could compensate the wrong dialog size.

description		read CD and get CDDB discid information
long_description	\
	In order to do CDDB queries over the Internet, you must know the DiscID \
	of the CD you are querying. cd-discid provides you with that information. \
	It outputs the discid, the number of tracks, the frame offset of all of \
	the tracks, and the total length of the CD in seconds, on one line in a \
	space-delimited format. cd-discid was designed as a backend tool for \
	cdgrab (now abcde) but will work independantly of it.

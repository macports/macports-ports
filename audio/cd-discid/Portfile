description             read CD and get CDDB discid information

long_description        In order to do CDDB queries over the Internet, you \
                        must know the DiscID of the CD you are querying. \
                        cd-discid provides you with that information. It \
                        outputs the discid, the number of tracks, the frame \
                        offset of all of the tracks, and the total length \
                        of the CD in seconds, on one line in a \
                        space-delimited format. cd-discid was designed as a \
                        backend tool for cdgrab (now abcde) but will work \
                        independantly of it.

description      A generator for simple sound effects.
long_description A port of DrPetter's sfxr with a native Mac UI. \
                 In DrPetter's words: Its original purpose was to provide a \
                 simple means of getting basic sound effects into a game for \
                 those people who were working hard to get their entries \
                 done within the 48 hours and didn't have time to spend \
                 looking for suitable ways of doing this.

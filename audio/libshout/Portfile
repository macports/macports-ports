long_description	  \
	A port of the libshout library. Libshout allows applications to \
	easily communicate and broadcast to an Icecast streaming media \
	server. It handles the socket connections, metadata communication, \
	and data streaming for the calling application, and lets developers \
	focus on feature sets instead of implementation  details.

description	Data and connectivity library for the icecast server
long_description	  A port of the libshout library. Libshout allows \
	applications to easily communicate and broadcast to an Icecast \
	streaming media server. It handles the socket connections, metadata \
	communication, and data streaming for the calling application, and \
	lets developers focus on feature sets instead of implementation \
	details.

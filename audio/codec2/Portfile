long_description    Codec 2 is an open source speech codec designed for \
    communications quality speech between 700 and 3200 bit/s. The main \
    application is low bandwidth HF/VHF digital radio. It fills a gap in \
    open source voice codecs beneath 5000 bit/s and is released under the \
    GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Informal listening tests \
    indicate that Codec 2 at 700 bits/s has better speech quality than \
    MELP and is comparable to TWELP at 600 bit/s.  The Codec 2 project \
    also contains several modems (OFDM, FDMDV, COHPSK and mFSK) carefully \
    designed for digital voice over HF radio.

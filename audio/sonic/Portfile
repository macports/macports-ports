description         Simple library to speed up or slow down speech

long_description    Sonic is a simple algorithm for speeding up or slowing down speech.  However, \
                    it's optimized for speed ups of over 2X, unlike previous algorithms for changing \
                    speech rate.  The Sonic library is a very simple ANSI C library that is designed \
                    to easily be integrated into streaming voice applications, like TTS back ends.

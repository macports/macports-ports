description         Libzita-resampler is a C++ library for resampling audio \
                    signals.
long_description    {*}${description} It is designed to be used within a \
                    real-time processing context, to be fast, and to provide \
                    high-quality sample rate conversion.\
                    The library operates on signals represented in \
                    single-precision floating point format. For multichannel \
                    operation both the input and output signals are assumed to \
                    be stored as interleaved samples.\
                    The API allows a trade-off between quality and CPU load. \
                    For the latter a range of approximately 1:6 is available. \
                    Even at the highest quality setting libzita-resampler will \
                    be faster than most similar libraries, e.g. libsamplerate.

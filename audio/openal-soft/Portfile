description             cross-platform software implementation of the OpenAL \
                        3D audio API

long_description        OpenAL Soft is a ${description}. It's forked from the \
                        open-sourced Windows version available originally \
                        from the SVN repository at openal.org. OpenAL \
                        provides capabilities for playing audio in a virtual \
                        3D environment. Distance attenuation, doppler shift, \
                        and directional sound emitters are among the features \
                        handled by the API. More advanced effects, including \
                        air absorption, occlusion, and environmental reverb, \
                        are available through the EFX extension. It also \
                        facilitates streaming audio, multi-channel buffers, \
                        and audio capture.

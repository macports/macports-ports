description         Speech recognition package
long_description    PocketSphinx is CMU’s fastest speech recognition system. \
                    It is a library written in pure C which is optimal for \
                    development of your C applications as well as for \
                    development of language bindings. \
                    At real time speed it’s the most accurate engine, \
                    and therefore it is a good choice for live applications.

description             audio codec designed for speech

long_description        Speex is an Open Source/Free Software \
                        patent-free audio compression format \
                        designed for speech. The Speex Project \
                        aims to lower the barrier of entry for \
                        voice applications by providing a free \
                        alternative to expensive proprietary \
                        speech codecs.  Moreover, Speex is \
                        well-adapted to Internet applications \
                        and provides useful features that are \
                        not present in most other codecs.

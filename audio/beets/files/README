Please note that the beets-full port is simply a meta-port that
installs all plugins of the beets music library manager and
MusicBrainz tagger that MacPorts ships.

When MacPorts ships new versions of the beets-full, this port
will be updated so that the new plugins are installed on your
system when you upgrade outdated ports.

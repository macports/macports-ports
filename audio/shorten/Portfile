description	Fast compression for waveform files
long_description	  Shorten reduces the size of waveform files (such \
	as audio) using Huffman coding of prediction residuals and optional \
	additional quantisation.  In lossless mode the amount of compression \
	obtained depends on the nature of the waveform.  Those composing of \
	low frequencies and low amplitudes give the best compression, which \
	may be 2:1 or better.  Lossy compression operates by specifying a \
	minimum acceptable segmental signal to noise ratio or a maximum bit \
	rate. Lossy compression operates by zeroing the lower order bits of \
	the waveform, so retaining waveform shape.

description         open source audio signal processing and algorithmic \
                    synthesis classes

long_description    The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK) is a set of open source \
                    audio signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes \
                    written in the C++ programming language. \
                    STK was designed to facilitate rapid development of music \
                    synthesis and audio processing software, with an emphasis \
                    on cross-platform functionality, realtime control, ease of \
                    use, and educational example code. \
                    The Synthesis ToolKit is extremely portable (it's mostly \
                    platform-independent C and C++ code), and it's completely \
                    user-extensible (all source included, no unusual \
                    libraries, and no hidden drivers). \
                    We like to think that this increases the chances that our \
                    programs will still work in another 5-10 years. \
                    In fact, the ToolKit has been working continuously for \
                    nearly 20 years now. \
                    STK currently runs with realtime support (audio and MIDI) \
                    on Linux, macOS, and Windows computer platforms. \
                    Generic, non-realtime support has been tested under \
                    NeXTStep, Sun, and other platforms and should work with \
                    any standard C++ compiler.

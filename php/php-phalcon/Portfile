description             full stack PHP framework written as an extension

long_description        Phalcon is an open source, full stack framework for \
                        PHP 5 written as a C extension, optimized for high \
                        performance. Phalcon is a loosely coupled set of PHP \
                        classes, allowing you to use its objects as glue \
                        components based on the needs of your application. \
                        Phalcon is not only about performance\; the goal is \
                        to make it robust, rich in features and easy to use!

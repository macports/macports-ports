long_description    Suhosin is an advanced protection system for PHP\
                    installations. It was designed to protect servers and users\
                    from known and unknown flaws in PHP applications and the\
                    PHP core. Suhosin is binary compatible to normal PHP\
                    installations, which means it is compatible to 3rd party\
                    binary extensions like ZendOptimizer.

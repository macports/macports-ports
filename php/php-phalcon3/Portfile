description             full stack PHP framework written as an extension

long_description        Phalcon is an open source full stack framework for \
                        PHP, written as a C-extension. Phalcon is optimized \
                        for high performance. Its unique architecture allows \
                        the framework to always be memory resident, offering \
                        its functionality whenever it's needed, without \
                        expensive file stats and file reads that traditional \
                        PHP frameworks employ.

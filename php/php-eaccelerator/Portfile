description         php5 extension for PHP acceleration, optimization, and \
                    dynamic content caching
long_description    eAccelerator is a free open-source PHP accelerator, \
                    optimizer, and dynamic content cache. It increases the \
                    performance of PHP scripts by caching them in their \
                    compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is \
                    almost completely eliminated. It also optimizes scripts \
                    to speed up their execution. eAccelerator typically \
                    reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP \
                    code by 1-10 times.

# The Tin development model is based on patchsets, as indicated in
# the doc/CHANGES file.  There are:
#  * stable patches, numbered ddd (001, 002, and so on), which are
#    applied to the current stable branch, and in general, to the
#    unstable branch too (i.e. when there is one and when this makes
#    sense);
#  * unstable patches (new features), numbered Uddd (U001, U002,
#    and so on), which are applied to the unstable branch only.
# In general, at some point in the time, there are two currently
# supported branches: a stable branch (e.g. 1.6) and an unstable
# branch (e.g. 1.7).  At some later point (i.e. after a feature
# freeze?), the development line (coming from the unstable branch)
# is regarded as stable; this leads to a new stable release (e.g.
# 1.8.0) and a new stable branch (e.g. 1.8).  At this point, the
# old stable branch (e.g. 1.6) is abandonned.  Then the new stable
# branch (1.8) gets stable patches as usual (fixes, translation
# updates...), leading to new stable releases (e.g. 1.8.1), which
# correspond to the latest unstable release (e.g. 1.7.10) + bug
# fixes.  As soon as the first unstable patch (U001) needs to be
# applied, a new unstable branch (e.g. 1.9) is created (split from
# the current stable branch).

# Portfile update policy: Follow the development line as shown on
# <http://www.tin.org/history.html>, preferring unstable versions
# to stable ones when there is a split, i.e. stay on the right.
# The goal of this tin-recent port (as opposed to tin and tin-devel)
# is to have the highest upstream version (regarded as either stable
# or unstable), i.e. with the latest features, using a single port,
# thus benefiting from some port management features, such as those
# provided by "port outdated" and "port upgrade".

# For instance, if ports are updated as soon as tin versions are
# released:
#    tin   tin-devel   tin-recent
#   1.6.2    1.7.9       1.7.9
#   1.6.2    1.7.10      1.7.10
#   1.8.0    1.7.10      1.8.0
#   1.8.1    1.7.10      1.8.1
#   1.8.1    1.9.0       1.9.0
#   1.8.1    1.9.1       1.9.1
#   1.8.2    1.9.1       1.9.1
#   1.8.3    1.9.2       1.9.2
# where:
#   1.7.9  =  1.7.8  + patches U040 to U045.
#   1.7.10 =  1.7.9  + patches U046 to U052.
#   1.8.0  =  1.7.10 + patches U053 to U056.
#   1.8.1  =  1.8.0  + patches 001 to 006.
#   1.9.0  =  1.8.1  + patches 007, 008 and U001.
#   1.9.1  =  1.9.0  + patches 009 and U002.
#   1.8.2  =  1.8.1  + patches 007 to 011.
#   1.8.3  =  1.8.2  + patches 012 to 018.
#   1.9.2  =  1.9.1  + patches 010 to 018 and U003 to U006.
#   1.9.3  =  1.9.2  + patches 019 to 020 and U007 to U010.
#   1.9.4  =  1.9.3  + patches 021 and U011 to U013.
#   1.9.5  =  1.9.4  + patches U014 to U019.
# Said otherwise:
#   1.8.1  =  1.8.0  + patches 001 to 006.
#   1.9.0  =  1.8.0  + patches 001 to 008 and U001.
#   1.9.1  =  1.8.0  + patches 001 to 009 and U001 to U002.
#   1.8.2  =  1.8.0  + patches 001 to 011.
#   1.8.3  =  1.8.0  + patches 001 to 018.
#   1.9.2  =  1.8.0  + patches 001 to 018 and U001 to U006.
#   1.9.3  =  1.8.0  + patches 001 to 020 and U001 to U010.
#   1.9.4  =  1.8.0  + patches 001 to 021 and U001 to U013.
#   1.9.5  =  1.8.0  + patches 001 to 021 and U001 to U019.

description         A Usenet newsreader

long_description    TIN is a full-screen easy to use Usenet newsreader. \
                    It can read news locally or remotely via a NNTP \
                    server. It will automatically utilize NOV \
                    newsoverview style index files if available locally \
                    or via the NNTP (X)OVER command (RFC2980). \
                    Portfile update policy: follow the development line \
                    as shown on <http://www.tin.org/history.html>, \
                    preferring unstable versions at a split.

# The libraries libintl, libiconv and libpcre are needed by tin. If the

# the same as in MacPorts). However it is recommended to use the libraries

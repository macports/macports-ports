description         Litecoin is a P2P Internet currency that enables instant payments to anyone in the world.
long_description    Litecoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant payments\
                    to anyone in the world. It is based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs\
                    from Bitcoin in that it can be efficiently mined with consumer-grade hardware.\
                    Litecoin provides faster transaction confirmations (2.5 minutes on average)\
                    and uses memory-hard, scrypt-based mining proof-of-work algorithm to target\
                    the regular computers and GPUs most people already have. The Litecoin network\
                    is scheduled to produce 84 million currency units.\
                    \
                    One of the aims of Litecoin was to provide a mining algorithm that could run\
                    at the same time, on the same hardware used to mine bitcoins. With the rise\
                    of specialized ASICs for Bitcoin, Litecoin continues to satisfy these goals.\
                    It is unlikely for ASIC mining to be developed for Litecoin until the currency\
                    is widely used.

description         Like file\(1\) but for numbers

long_description    \
    The numchk tool is a command-line tool that identifies self-consistent \
    numbers and checks their correctness. In short, it is like file\(1\) for \
    numbers. \
    \
    The focus is on fast bulk processing of identifiers arising primarily in \
    the financial sector. Unlike similar libraries numchk only provides \
    syntactic and first level semantic checks (mostly check digits and \
    country code validation) in order to identify and disambiguate the input. \
    Deep semantic verification, aspects of formatting and canonicalisation \
    are left to its competitors.

description		PloneKeywordManager product for use with Zope CMF/Plone
long_description	Plone Keyword Manager allows you to change, merge \
					and delete keywords in Plone and updates all \
					corresponding objects automatically.  It uses a \
					similiarity search to support you in identifying \
					similar keywords. PloneKeywordManager helps you to \
					build an inductive vocabulary with several people \
					working on the same Plone site.  Keywords can be \
					cleaned up from time to time by a site-manager to \
					create a consistent vocabulary.

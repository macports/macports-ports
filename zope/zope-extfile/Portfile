description		This is the ExtFile/ExtImage Zope Product.
long_description	The ExtFile Product stores large files in an \
					external file-repository and is able to display \
					icons for different MIME-Types.  The ExtImage \
					Product additionally creates preview-thumbnails from \
					various images and displays them.  ExtFile and \
					ExtImage basically work like the Zope File and Image \
					products. The difference is, that the File/Image \
					Products stores the (binary) file inside the ZODB, \
					wheras ExtFile/ExtImage stores it externally in a \
					repository directory (default: <zope-dir>/var/reposit). \
					Only meta data (like title and description) are \
					stored in the Database. This prevents the Database \
					swelling up quickly, when many large files are \
					uploaded and thus increasing database performance.

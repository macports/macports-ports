description		RevisionManager is a CVS frontend for Zope.
long_description	RevisionManager is a CVS frontend for Zope. It \
					brings the power of revision controlling to the \
					ZODB.  It introduces all common cvs commands to \
					Zope. These include importing, checking in and out, \
					updating, adding and removing files, tagging and \
					branching.  The three common access methods are \
					supported: \
					- local, i.e. the repository is on the same machine \
					as the Zope server \
					- server (a.k.a. ext) using rsh or ssh (ssh must be \
					used with public key authentication) \
					- pserver, the password server. \
					Additional features: \
					- RevisionManager can use the Zope user id to \
					connect to a RSH/SSH or pserver server \
					- Upon committing, RevisionManager can include the \
					ZODB history of the objects in questions in the CVS \
					log. \
					- When enabled, RevisionManager stores properties of \
					objects in separate .properties files (when \
					supported).

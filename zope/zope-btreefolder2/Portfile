description		Zope folder that can contain many more objects efficiently
long_description	When you fill a Zope folder with too many \
					objects, both Zope and your browser get \
					overwhelmed. Zope has to load and store a large \
					folder object, and the browser has to render \
					large HTML tables repeatedly. Zope can store a \
					lot of objects, but it has trouble storing a lot \
					of objects in a single standard Zope folder. \
					BTreeFolder2 solves this problem by storing the \
					objects in Zope BTrees, special structures \
					designed for the Zope object database. BTrees \
					can hold numerous items without loading them all \
					into memory at once.

description         A decoder implementation of the JBIG2 image \
                    compression format
long_description    JBIG2 is designed for lossy or lossless encoding \
                    of 'bilevel' (1-bit monochrome) images at \
                    moderately high resolution, and in particular \
                    scanned paper documents. In this domain it can be \
                    very efficient, offering compression ratios on the \
                    order of 100:1. This is a decoder only \
                    implementation, and its primary use is in \
                    Ghostscript and MuPDF for decoding JBIG2 streams \
                    in PDF files. Thus its primary focus is the set of \
                    JBIG2 features supported in PDF.

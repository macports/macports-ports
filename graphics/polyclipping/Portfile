description         Polygon and line clipping and offsetting library
long_description    Clipper library performs clipping and offsetting for both \
                    lines and polygons. All four boolean clipping operations are \
                    supported - intersection, union, difference and exclusive-or. \
                    Polygons can be of any shape including self-intersecting polygons.

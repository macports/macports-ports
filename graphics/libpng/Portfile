name		libpng
version		1.2.10
categories	graphics
maintainers	waqar@opendarwin.org
description	Library for manipulating PNG images
long_description	\
	Libpng was written as a companion to the PNG specification, as a  \
	way to reduce the amount of time and effort it takes to support   \
	the PNG file format in application programs.  Most users will not \
	have to modify the library significantly, advanced users may want \
	to modify it more.  The library was coded for both users.  All    \
	attempts were made to make it as complete as possible, while      \
	keeping the code easy to understand.  Currently, this library     \
	only supports C.  Support for other languages is being considered.

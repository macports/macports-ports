description             Library for manipulating PNG images

long_description        Libpng was written as a companion to the PNG \
                        specification, as a way to reduce the amount of time \
                        and effort it takes to support the PNG file format in \
                        application programs. Most users will not have to \
                        modify the library significantly, advanced users may \
                        want to modify it more. The library was coded for \
                        both users. All attempts were made to make it as \
                        complete as possible, while keeping the code easy to \
                        understand. Currently, this library only supports C. \
                        Support for other languages is being considered.

description             Real-time interactive fractal zoomer

long_description        XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive \
                        fractal zoomer. It displays the Mandelbrot set \
                        (among other escape time fractals) and allows you to \
                        zoom smoothly into the fractal. Various coloring \
                        modes are provided for both the points inside and \
                        outside the selected set. In addition, switching \
                        between Julia and Mandelbrot fractal types and \
                        on-the-fly plane switching is provided. The first \
                        version was a minimal X Window Mandelbrot viewer \
                        by Thomas later modified by Jan to support high \
                        frame-rate zooming. Other additions were later \
                        made by both Thomas and Jan including autopilot \
                        (for those of you without drivers licenses), \
                        palette changing, GIF saving, and fractal inversion.

	real-time interactive fractal zoomer

long_description \
	XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer. \
	It displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape time fractals) \
	and allows you zoom smoothly into the fractal. Various coloring \
	modes are provided for both the points inside and outside the \
	selected set. In addition, switching between Julia and Mandelbrot \
	fractal types and on-the-fly plane switching is provided. The \
	first version was a minimal X Window Mandelbrot viewer by Thomas \
	later modified by Jan to support high frame-rate zooming. Other \
	additions were later made by both Thomas and Jan including \
	autopilot (for those of you without drivers licenses), palette \
	changing, GIF saving, and fractal inversion.

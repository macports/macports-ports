description                     OpenEXR Math Library
long_description                Imath is a basic, light-weight, and efficient C++ representation of \
                                2D and 3D vectors and matrices and other simple but useful \
                                mathematical objects, functions, and data types common in computer \
                                graphics applications, including the "half" 16-bit floating-point type. \
                                Imath also includes optional python bindings for all types and functions, \
                                including optimized implementations of vector and matrix arrays.

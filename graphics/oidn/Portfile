description         denoising filters for images rendered with ray \
                    tracing
long_description    Open Image Denoise is a library of ${description}, \
                    developed at Intel. Its purpose is to provide an \
                    efficient denoising library that allows \
                    ray-tracing-based rendering applications to \
                    significantly reduce rendering times.

# OIDN requires a compiler that has OpenMP support (specifically,
# support for '-fopenmp-simd'). None of the compilers provided by Xcode
# have any support for OpenMP, so we need to blacklist all Xcode clangs.
# Note: Even though OIDN requires a compiler that has OpenMP support,
# it doesn't mean that we need to add port:libomp as a depends_lib. In
# fact, the '-fopenmp-simd' flag was created specifically to allow
# processing of 'simd' and 'declare simd' pragmas without needing to
# link to libomp/libgomp/etc. (References:

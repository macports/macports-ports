description             Little Color Management System, a color matching \
                        method library
long_description        LCMS is the Little Color Management System, a Color \
                        Matching Method (CMM) library which implements fast \
                        transforms between ICC profiles. It is released under \
                        LGPL with source code and meant to be portable. \
                        Color management refers to techniques that ensure \
                        consistent color as images are transferred from \
                        scanners or cameras to monitors and printers.

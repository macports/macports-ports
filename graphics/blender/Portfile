long_description    Blender is a ${description}. It contains a set of \
                    tools that can be used for all phases of the 3-D \
                    computer graphics pipeline, including modeling, \
                    sculpting, texturing, rigging, animation, \
                    simulation, rendering, compositing, motion \
                    tracking, and video editing. It can be used for \
                    creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3-D \
                    printing, motion graphics, interactive 3-D \
                    applications, and computer games.

        # ccl::OSLRenderServices::~OSLRenderServices() in

        # -DCOMPILER_HAS_F_ALIGNED_NEW=OFF, but it turns out that the
        # error is actually being caused by the fact that the devs are
        # adding -faligned-allocation in the file
        # 'intern/cycles/kernel/osl/CMakeLists.txt'. It seems that the
        # real problem is that Clang on older macOSes do not have
        # aligned allocation when compiling using C++17. Thus, we need
        # use -fno-aligned-allocation. However, we also cannot simply
        # remove the section of code from 'CMakeLists.txt' that adds
        # -faligned-allocation, because if we do, the build will fail
        # with the warning/error: "aligned deallocation function of type
        # 'void (void *, std::align_val_t) noexcept' is only available
        # on macOS 10.14 or newer"; "note: if you supply your own
        # aligned allocation functions, use -faligned-allocation to
        # silence this diagnostic". Thus, in order to build
        # successfully, we need to explicitly use
        # -fno-aligned-allocation on older macOSes, and explicitly use
        # -faligned-allocation on newer macOSes.

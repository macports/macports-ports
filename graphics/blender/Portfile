long_description    Blender is a ${description}. It contains a set of \
                    tools that can be used for all phases of the 3-D \
                    computer graphics pipeline, including modeling, \
                    sculpting, texturing, rigging, animation, \
                    simulation, rendering, compositing, motion \
                    tracking, and video editing. It can be used for \
                    creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3-D \
                    printing, motion graphics, interactive 3-D \
                    applications, and computer games.

description         C++ library for manipulating a variety of particle \
                    formats
long_description    Partio is an open-source C++ library, developed by \
                    Walt Disney Animation Studios, for reading, \
                    writing, and manipulating a variety of standard \
                    particle formats (GEO, BGEO, PTC, PDB, PDA). It \
                    allows software applications to read and write \
                    point cloud formats from a variety of computer \
                    graphics programs and can serve as a way to \
                    interchange particle data between various file \
                    formats.

description         Library and tools for dealing with Tag Image File Format
long_description    \
    This software provides support for the Tag Image File       \
    Format (TIFF), a widely used format for storing image       \
    data.  Included in this software distribution is a          \
    library, libtiff, for reading and writing TIFF, a small     \
    collection of tools for doing simple manipulations of       \
    TIFF images on UNIX systems, documentation on the library   \
    and tools.  A small assortment of TIFF-related software     \
    for UNIX that has been contributed by others is also        \
    included.  The library is capable of dealing with images    \
    that are written to follow the 5.0 or 6.0 TIFF spec.        \
    There is also considerable support for some of the more     \
    esoteric portions of the 6.0 TIFF spec.

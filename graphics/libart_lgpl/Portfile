description     fast 2D image manipulation library

long_description \
    Libart is a library for high-performance 2D graphics. \
    It supports a very powerful imaging model, basically the \
    same as SVG and the Java 2D API. It includes all \
    PostScript imaging operations, and adds antialiasing and \
    alpha-transparency. It is also highly tuned for \
    incremental rendering. It contains data structures and \
    algorithms suited to rapid, precise computation of Region \
    of Interest, and a two-phase rendering pipeline optimized \
    for interactive display.

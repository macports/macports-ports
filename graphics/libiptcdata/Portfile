long_description \
    libiptcdata is a library for manipulating the International \
    Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) metadata stored \
    within multimedia files such as images. This metadata can \
    include captions and keywords, often used by popular photo \
    management applications. The libiptcdata package also \
    includes a command-line utility, iptc, for editing IPTC \
    data in JPEG files.

long_description    A powerful GTK 3 based command-line image viewer \
                    with a minimal UI. It is highly customizable, can \
                    be fully controlled from scripts, and has support \
                    for various file formats including PDF, \
                    Postscript, video files and archives. It is \
                    optimized to be quick and responsive. \
                    \
                    It comes with support for animations, slideshows, \
                    transparency, VIM-like key bindings, automated \
                    loading of new images as they appear, external \
                    image filters, marks, image preloading, and much \
                    more. \
                    \
                    pqiv started as a Python rewrite of qiv avoiding \
                    imlib, but evolved into a much more powerful tool. \
                    Today, pqiv stands for powerful quick image viewer.

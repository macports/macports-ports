description         Data Matrix library

long_description    libdmtx is open source software for reading and writing \
                    Data Matrix barcodes. Data Matrix barcodes are \
                    two-dimensional symbols that hold a dense pattern of data \
                    with built-in error correction. The Data Matrix symbology \
                    (sometimes casually referred to as DataMatrix) was \
                    invented and released into the public domain by RVSI \
                    Acuity CiMatrix. Wikipedia has a good article on the \
                    symbology and its characteristics.

# In boost 1.59.0, a number of symbols related to the Boost.System library have been renamed
# for compatibility with the C++ committee's standard library specs.  The old symbols have been deprecated
# and aliases to the new symbols are provided.  When boost headers are included, these aliases
# can create dependencies on the Boost.System library even if no Boost.System symbols are actually used.
# Typically this causes missing symbol errors during linking when LDFLAGS (legitimately) does not
# include -lboost_system-mt.
#
# Asserting BOOST_SYSTEM_NO_DEPRECATED deactivates these aliases allowing this and other affected
# ports to build as before.
#
# See http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/system/doc/reference.html#Deprecated-names for details
#
# This workaround can be removed when the offending deprecation aliases are removed in a future
# version of boost.

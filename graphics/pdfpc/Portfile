    speaker during the presentation.

    It is able to show a normal presentation window on one screen, while showing \
    a more sophisticated overview on the other one providing information like \
    a picture of the next slide, as well as the left over time till the end of \
    the presentation. The input files processed by pdfpc are PDF documents, \
    which can be created using nearly any of today's presentation software.

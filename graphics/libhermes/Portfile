description	Hermes is a pixel conversion library.
long_description	Hermes is a pixel conversion library. Its only purpose \
		is to take a buffer full of pixels and convert it into a \
		target buffer full of pixels. The two can differ both in size \
		and in format. Hermes is primarily intended for fast graphics \
		display and it is optimized for that. Where this goal can be \
		achieved by dismissing minimal graphic errors, Hermes will do \
		so (minimal means almost not noticeable). But that is likely \
		to be very configurable in the near future to allow for user \
		selection of trade-off.

description         Validate and inspect PNG, JNG and MNG files
long_description    ${name} verifies the integrity of PNG, JNG and MNG files \
                    (by checking the internal 32-bit CRCs [checksums] and \
                    decompressing the image data)\; it can optionally dump \
                    almost all of the chunk-level information in the image in \
                    human-readable form. For example, it can be used to print \
                    the basic statistics about an image (dimensions, bit \
                    depth, etc.)\; to list the color and transparency info in \
                    its palette (assuming it has one)\; or to extract the \
                    embedded text annotations. This is a command-line program \
                    with batch capabilities.

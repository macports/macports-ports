description                 Frontends for scanner access

long_description            These are the frontends for the Scanner Access Now \
                            Easy project. They allow you to access various \
                            scanners either locally or remote using saned.

# The SANE project has not released an updated sane-frontends
# tarball in nearly 5 years.  However, they have made updates
# to sane-frontends as the API for sane-backends has changed
# over that time.  Accordingly, it appears that fetching
# sane-frontends from the official git repository is the
# best bet for getting a compilable sane-frontends

description         stream-based library for reading and writing \
                    COLLADA files
long_description    OpenCOLLADA is a library that allows computer \
                    graphics software applications to read and write \
                    COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) files. \
                    COLLADA files are typically XML-based documents \
                    identified with a .dae (digital asset exchange) \
                    filename extension.

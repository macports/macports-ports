description     NVIDIA's Cg high-level shading language
long_description \
    Cg (short for C for Graphics) is a high-level shading language \
    developed by Nvidia in close collaboration with Microsoft for \
    programming vertex and pixel shaders.  It is very similar to \
    Microsoft's HLSL.  Cg is based on the C programming language and \
    although they share the same syntax, some features of C were \
    modified and new data types were added to make Cg more suitable \
    for programming graphics processing units.  This language is only \
    suitable for GPU programming and is not a general programming \
    language.  The Cg compiler outputs DirectX or OpenGL shader \
    programs.

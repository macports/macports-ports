long_description \
    libicns is a library for manipulation of the Mac OS icns resource format, also known \
    as the IconFamily resource type. It can read and write files from the Mac OS X icns \
    format, as well as read from Mac OS resource files and macbinary encoded Mac OS \
    resource forks. As of release 0.5.9, it can fully read and write any 128x128 and all \
    smaller 32-bit icons, and read support for 8-bit, 4-bit, and 1-bit icons. If linked \
    against (a patched version of) Jasper, it also has full support for 256x256 and 512x512 \
    32-bit icons with masks as alpha channels. libicns includes icns2png, a tool for extracting \
    the images contained within icns files, and saving them as png images. It also includes \
    png2icns, a tool for creating icns files from a set of png images. \
    Furthermore, release 0.8.1 implements 1024x1024 support.

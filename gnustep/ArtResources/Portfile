    FreeFonts and Vera fonts and mknfonts for gnustep art backend. \
    The Vera fonts are well-suited to on-screen use, and it is recommended \
    that you use these as your default fonts. \
    \
    The FreeFonts are not as well-suited as the Vera fonts to on-screen \
    use, but they contain a lot more characters.

description         A Routing package for Python that matches \
                    URLs to dicts and vice versa.
long_description    Routes is a Python re-implementation of the \
                    Rails routes system for mapping URLs to \
                    Controllers/Actions and generating URLs. \
                    Routes makes it easy to create pretty and \
                    concise URLs that are RESTful with little \
                    effort.

description       Framework to process interdependent tasks in a pool of workers
long_description  Async is one more attempt to make the definition and \
                  execution of asynchronous interdependent operations easy. \
                  For that to work, you may define tasks which communicate \
                  with each other by channels. Channels transfer items, which \
                  is very similar to bytes flowing through pipes uses in \
                  inter-process communication.  Items will only be generated \
                  on demand, that is when you read from the respective output \
                  channel.

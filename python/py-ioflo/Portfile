description         ioflo is a framework and DSL for building reasoning \
                    automation systems.
long_description    IoFlo is a magically powerful open interoperable software \
                    framework that enables non experts to intelligently \
                    automate their own programmable world. IoFlo has its roots \
                    in the research and development of autonomous underwater \
                    vehicles, autonomic ships, and automated buildings. These \
                    are cool applications that can be scarily complex. That \
                    complexity was the prime motivation for IoFlo and its \
                    ancestors, to make programming autonomous/autonomic systems \
                    easy even for people without PhDs.

    sudo port select --set ${select.group} [file tail ${select.file}]

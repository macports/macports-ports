description		formatted input from standard input similar to scanf from C
long_description	scanf provides formatted input from standard input, \
					strings, or files, using a format-string syntax that is \
					similar to scanf() from C. The syntax should be familiar \
					to C programmers, and offers very simple pattern matching \
					against strings and files.

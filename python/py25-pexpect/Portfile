description   python module for better controlling other applications
long_description Pexpect makes Python a better tool for controlling \
  other applications. It is a pure Python module for spawning child \
  applications, controlling them and responding to expected patterns in \
  their output. Pexpect works like Don Libes Expect. Pexpect allows your \
  script to spawn a child application and control it as if a human were \
  typing commands.

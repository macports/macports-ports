description			Python binding for the ORBit2 CORBA ORB - Default branch.
long_description	PyORBit is a Python binding for the ORBit2 CORBA ORB. It \
					was developped to suit the needs of the bonobo bindings \
					in GNOME-Python, but is usable for other purposes as well. \
					It aims to follow the standard Python language mapping for \
					CORBA. It can generate stubs at runtime from typelibs, IDL \
					files, or by introspecting remote objects using ORBit2's \
					IModule typelib capabilities.

description         Quixote is a framework for developing Web applications in Python
long_description    ${description}. Its design goals were to allow easy \
                    development of Web applications where the accent is \
                    more on complicated programming logic than complicated \
                    templating, to make the templating language as similar \
                    to Python as possible. The aim is to make as many of \
                    the skills and techniques learned from writing regular \
                    Python code applicable to the task of writing Web \
                    applications.

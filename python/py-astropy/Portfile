description         A Community Python Library for Astronomy
long_description    The Astropy project is a common effort to develop \
                    a single core package for Astronomy. Major packages such \
                    as PyFITS, PyWCS, vo, and asciitable already merged in, \
                    and many more components being worked on. In particular, \
                    we are developing imaging, photometric, and spectroscopic \
                    functionality, as well as frameworks for cosmology, unit \
                    handling, and coordinate transformations.

description		    Using processes which mimics the threading module
long_description    Processing is a package for the Python language which \
                    supports the spawning of processes using the API of \
                    the standard library's threading module.  Objects can \
                    be transferred between processes using pipes or \
                    multi-producer/multi-consumer queues.  Objects can be \
                    shared between processes using a server process or \
                    (for simple data) shared memory.  Equivalents of all \
                    the synchronization primitives in threading are \
                    available.  A Pool class makes it easy to submit \
                    tasks to a pool of worker processes.

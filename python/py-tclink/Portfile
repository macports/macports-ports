long_description    TCLink is an LGPL'd thin client API which can run credit card transactions over TCP/IP. \
                    A similar package is Red Hat's ccvs, however, it requires that you use a modem or leased \
                    line. With TCLink you can run credit card transactions directly over the Internet.

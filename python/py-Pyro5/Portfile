long_description    \
    Pyro means PYthon Remote Objects. It is a library that \
    enables you to build applications in which objects can talk to each \
    other over the network, with minimal programming effort. You can just \
    use normal Python method calls, with almost every possible parameter \
    and return value type, and Pyro takes care of locating the right object \
    on the right computer to execute the method. It is designed to be very easy \
    to use, and to generally stay out of your way. But it also provides a set \
    of powerful features that enables you to build distributed applications \
    rapidly and effortlessly. Pyro is written in 100% pure Python.

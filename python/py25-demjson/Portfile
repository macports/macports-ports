description       encoder, decoder, and validator for JSON compliant with RFC 4627
long_description  encoder, decoder, and lint/validator for JSON (JavaScript \
                  Object Notation) compliant with RFC 4627. This module \
                  provides classes and functions for encoding or decoding data \
                  represented in the language-neutral JSON format. This \
                  implementation tries to be as compliant to the JSON \
                  specification (RFC 4627) as possible, while still providing \
                  many optional extensions to allow less restrictive \
                  JavaScript syntax. It includes complete Unicode support, \
                  including UTF-32, BOM, and surrogate pair processing. It can \
                  also support JavaScript's NaN and Infinity numeric types as \
                  well as its 'undefined' type. It also includes a lint-like \
                  JSON syntax validator which tests JSON text for strict \
                  compliance to the standard.

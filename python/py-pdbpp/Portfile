description         pdb++, a drop-in replacement for pdb
long_description    This module is an extension of the pdb module of the standard library. \
                    It is meant to be fully compatible with its predecessor, \
                    yet it introduces a number of new features \
                    to make your debugging experience as nice as possible.

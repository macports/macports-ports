description         A library and command line utility for diffing xml
long_description    xmldiff is a library and a command-line utility for making diffs out\
                    of XML. This may seem like something that doesnâ€™t need a dedicated \
                    utility, but change detection in hierarchical data is very \
                    different from change detection in flat data. XML type formats are \
                    also not only used for computer readable data, it is also often \
                    used as a format for hierarchical data that can be rendered into \
                    human readable formats. A traditional diff on such a format would \
                    tell you line by line the differences, but this would not be be \
                    readable by a human. xmldiff provides tools to make human readable \
                    diffs in those situations.

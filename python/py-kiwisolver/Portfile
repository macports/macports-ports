description         Kiwi is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint solving algorithm.
long_description    Kiwi is an implementation of the algorithm based on the\
                    seminal Cassowary paper. It is not a refactoring of the\
                    original C++ solver. Kiwi has been designed from the ground\
                    up to be lightweight and fast. Kiwi ranges from 10x to 500x\
                    faster than the original Cassowary solver with typical use\
                    cases gaining a 40x improvement. Memory savings are\
                    consistently > 5x.

long_description \
   buzhug is a fast, pure-Python database engine, using a syntax that Python \
   programmers should find very intuitive.  The data is stored and accessed \
   on disk (it is not an in-memory database).  The implementation has been \
   designed to make all operations, and especially selection, as fast as \
   possible with an interpreted language

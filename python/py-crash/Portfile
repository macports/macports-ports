description	Python crash handler that handles uncaught exceptions
long_description	PyCrash is a crash handler that handles uncaught \
			exceptions during program execution and collects \
			information about the program context. PyCrash can be \
			very useful in report bug information, because the \
			programmer can easily analyse the program execution \
			context of the crashed application. PyCrash needs \
			threads.

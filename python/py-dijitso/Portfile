description         A Python module for distributed just-in-time shared library building
long_description    This module was written to improve a core component of the \
                    FEniCS framework, namely the just in time compilation of \
                    C++ code that is generated from Python modules, but is \
                    only called from within a C++ library, and thus do not \
                    need wrapping in a nice Python interface.

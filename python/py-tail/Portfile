description         Simple implementation of GNU tail and head in Python
long_description  \
    Python tail is a simple implementation of GNU tail and head. \
    It provides 3 main functions that can be performed on any \
    file-like object that supports seek() and tell(): tail, head, \
    and follow. It also comes with pytail, a command line version \
    offering the same functionality as GNU tail. This can be particularly \
    useful on Windows systems that have no tail equivalent.

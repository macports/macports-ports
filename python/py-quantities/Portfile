description         Support for physical quantities with units, based on numpy
long_description    \
    Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic and conversions of physical \
    quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality specified by various \
    units, and possibly an uncertainty.  Quantities builds on the popular numpy \
    library and is designed to work with numpy ufuncs, many of which are \
    already supported. Quantities is actively developed, and while the current \
    features and API are stable, test coverage is incomplete so the package is \
    not suggested for mission-critical applications.

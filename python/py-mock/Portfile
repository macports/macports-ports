description         A Python Mocking and Patching Library for Testing
long_description  \
    mock is a Python module that provides a core Mock class. It removes the \
    need to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite. After \
    performing an action, you can make assertions about which methods / \
    attributes were used and arguments they were called with. You can also \
    specify return values and set needed attributes in the normal way.

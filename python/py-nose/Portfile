long_description		A unittest extension offering automatic test \
				suite discovery, simplified test authoring, \
				and output capture. Nose provides an alternate \
				test discovery and running process for \
				unittest, one that is intended to mimic the \
				behavior of py.test as much as is reasonably \
				possible without resorting to magic.

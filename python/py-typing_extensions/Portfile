description         Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python
long_description    The typing module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5 \
                    on a provisional basis and will no longer be provisional in Python \
                    3.7. However, this means users of Python 3.5 - 3.6 who are unable \
                    to upgrade will not be able to take advantage of new types added \
                    to the typing module, such as typing.Text or typing.Coroutine. \
                    The typing_extensions module contains both backports of these \
                    changes as well as experimental types that will eventually be \
                    added to the typing module, such as Protocol or TypedDict.

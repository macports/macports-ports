description         Python-powered Fortran preprocessor
long_description    Fypp is a Python-powered preprocessor. It can be used for any programming languages \
                    but its primary aim is to offer a Fortran preprocessor, which helps to extend Fortran \
                    with condititional compiling and template metaprogramming capabilities. \
                    Instead of introducing its own expression syntax, it uses Python expressions \
                    in its preprocessor directives, offering the consistency and versatility of Python \
                    when formulating metaprogramming tasks. It puts strong emphasis on robustness \
                    and on neat integration into developing toolchains.

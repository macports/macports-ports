description		backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network
long_description	rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, \
					possibly over a network. The target directory ends \
					up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse \
					diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that \
					target directory, so you can still recover files \
					lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best \
					features of a mirror and an incremental backup. \
					rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard \
					links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership, \
					and modification times. Also, rdiff-backup can \
					operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, \
					like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to \
					securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, \
					and only the differences will be transmitted. \
					Finally, rdiff-backup is easy to use and settings \
					have sensical defaults.

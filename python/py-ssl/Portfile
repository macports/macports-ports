description         SSL wrapper for socket objects
long_description        \
The old socket.ssl() support for TLS over sockets is being superseded in \
Python 2.6 by a new 'ssl' module. This package brings that module to older \
Python releases, 2.3.5 and up (it may also work on older versions of 2.3, but \
we haven't tried it).

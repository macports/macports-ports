long_description  \
    figleaf is a Python code coverage analysis tool, built somewhat on the model \
    of Ned Batchelder\'s fantastic coverage module. The goals of figleaf are to \
    be a minimal replacement of \'coverage.py\' that supports more configurable \
    coverage gathering and reporting.

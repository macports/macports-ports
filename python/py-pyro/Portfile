description         Distributed object middleware for Python (RPC)
long_description    Pyro means PYthon Remote Objects. It is a library that \
                    enables you to build applications in which objects can talk to \
                    eachother over the network, with minimal programming effort. You \
                    can just use normal Python method calls, with almost every \
                    possible parameter and return value type, and Pyro takes care of \
                    locating the right object on the right computer to execute the \
                    method. It is designed to be very easy to use, and to generallye \
                    stay out of your way. But it also provides a set of powerful \
                    features that enables you to build distributed applications \
                    rapidly and effortlessly.

description         spark is the little language compiler framework for python
long_description    SPARK stands for the Scanning, Parsing, and Rewriting \
                    Kit. It formerly had no name, and was referred to as \
                    the "little language framework." The first version \
                    (circa 1998) was described in the paper Compiling \
                    Little Languages in Python at the 7th International \
                    Python Conference.

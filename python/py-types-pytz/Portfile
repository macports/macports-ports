description         Typing stubs for pytz
long_description    {*}${description}. Typeshed contains external type \
                    annotations for the Python standard library and \
                    Python builtins, as well as third party packages \
                    as contributed by people external to those projects. \
                    This data can e.g. be used for static analysis, type \
                    checking or type inference.

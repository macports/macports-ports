long_description	Twisted.Web2 is the next generation Web Server \
			Framework built with Twisted. Web2 is under active \
			development and it's APIs should not be considered \
			stable at this point. It is not a version of \
			Twisted.Web and with that in mind compatibility is \
			not of the highest concern, though the compatibility \
			layer does support many but not all twisted.web \
			resources.

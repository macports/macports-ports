description             Collection of persistent (disk-based) queues
long_description        Queuelib is a collection of persistent (disk-based) \
                        queues for Python. Queuelib goals are speed and \
                        simplicity. It was originally part of the `Scrapy \
                        framework`_ and stripped out on its own library.

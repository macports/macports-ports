description	make replacement for use with python
long_description	pymake is a simple make replacement which allows the \
			specification  of file dependency graphs within \
			Python. With it, you can perform  conditional \
			complilation of source code, install software, run \
			scripts, or any repeatable sequence of tasks that ends \
			up creating a known set files on your filesystem. On \
			subsequent runs of the same set of tasks, pymake \
			performs the least amount of work possible to create \
			the same set of files, only performing the work that \
			it  detects has not already been performed by earlier \
			runs.

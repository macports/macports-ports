description		python class library for the generation of HTML documents
long_description	HTMLgen is a class library for the generation of HTML \
			documents with Python scripts. It's used when you want to create \
			HTML pages containing information which changes from time to time. \
			For example, you might want to have a page which provides an \
			overall system summary of data collected nightly. Or maybe you \
			have a catalog of data and images that you would like formed into \
			a spiffy set of web pages for the world to browse. Python is a \
			great scripting language for these tasks and with HTMLgen it is \
			very straightforward to construct objects which are rendered  out \
			into consistently structured web pages. Of course, CGI  scripts \
			written in Python can take advantage of these classes as  well.

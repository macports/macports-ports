description         python class library for the generation of HTML \
                    documents
long_description    HTMLgen is a class library for the generation of \
                    HTML documents with Python scripts. It's used when \
                    you want to create HTML pages containing \
                    information which changes from time to time. For \
                    example, you might want to have a page which \
                    provides an overall system summary of data \
                    collected nightly. Or maybe you have a catalog of \
                    data and images that you would like formed into \
                    a spiffy set of web pages for the world to browse. \
                    Python is a great scripting language for these tasks \
                    and with HTMLgen it is very straightforward to \
                    construct objects which are rendered out into \
                    consistently structured web pages. Of course, CGI \
                    scripts written in Python can take advantage of \
                    these classes as well.

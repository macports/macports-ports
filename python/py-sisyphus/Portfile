description		python module for running python stuff as cron jobs
long_description	This module simplifies running Python stuff as cron \
				jobs. There will be no more than one sisyphus job of a certain \
				name running at every given time. When the job is already \
				running and a second is started, the second one will quit \
				immediately if the first one hasn't exceeded its maximum \
				allowed lifetime yet. If it has exceeded the allowed lifetime \
				the first job will be killed and the second will start \
				running. In addition to that, logging features are provided.

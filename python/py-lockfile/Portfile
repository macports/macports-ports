description         Platform-independent file locking module
long_description  \
    This package exports a LockFile class which provides a simple API for \
    locking files. Unlike the Windows msvcrt.locking function, the fcntl.lockf \
    and flock functions, and the deprecated posixfile module, the API is \
    identical across both Unix (including Linux and Mac) and Windows platforms. \
    The lock mechanism relies on the atomic nature of the link (on Unix) and \
    mkdir (on Windows) system calls. An implementation based on SQLite is \
    also provided, more as a demonstration of the possibilities it provides \
    than as production-quality code.

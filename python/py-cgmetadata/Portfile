description         Read and write image metadata on macOS from Python using \
                    the native ImageIO / Core Graphics frameworks.
long_description    {*}${description} \
                    \n\
                    CGMetadata is a Python wrapper around the macOS ImageIO \
                    and Core Graphics frameworks. It provides a simple \
                    interface for reading and writing image metadata, \
                    including EXIF, IPTC, and XMP data. Reading is supported \
                    for all image formats supported by ImageIO. Reading is \
                    also supported for video formats using AVFoundation. \
                    \n\
                    Writing is not currently supported for RAW file formats \
                    nor for video formats. Writing of metadata has been \
                    tested on JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and HEIC files however it \
                    should be considered experimental. If you are using \
                    CGMetadata to write metadata to image files, please make \
                    sure you have tested the results before using it in \
                    production.

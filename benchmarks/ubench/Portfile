description      Unix Benchmark Utility for CPU(s) and memory
long_description \
    The Unix Benchmark Utility "ubench" is an attempt to introduce \
    a single measure of perfomance among computer systems running \
    various flavors of Unix operation system. The current \
    development release tests only CPU(s) and memory. In the future \
    releases there will be tests added for disk and TCP/IP. Ubench \
    is taking advantage of multiple CPUs on an SMP system and the \
    results will reflect that.

long_description        Bonnie++ is a benchmark suite that is aimed at \
                        performing a number of simple tests of hard drive \
                        and file system performance. Then you can decide which\
                        test is important and decide how to compare different\
                        systems after running it. I have no plans to ever \
                        have it produce a single number, because I don't think\
                        that a single number can be useful when comparing \
                        such things.

notes "
Darwin's sysconf() doesn't support _SC_PHYS_PAGES. Due to this limitation,\
Bonnie++ cannot detect the amount of physical memory automatically. To tell\
Bonnie++ a suitable RAM size, you can use -r option. For example, if your Mac\
has 4GB RAM, use:

    bonnie++ -r 4096 -d /tmp

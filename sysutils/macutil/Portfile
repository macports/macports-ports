description			Several *nix-based utilities for working with classic Mac \
					files
long_description \
	macutil contains the following utilities: \
	macunpack - unpacks PackIt, StuffIt, Diamond, Compactor/Compact Pro, \
	most StuffItClassic/StuffItDeluxe, and all Zoom and LHarc/MacLHa \
	archives, and archives created by later versions of DiskDoubler.  Also \
	it will decode files created by BinHex5.0, MacBinary, UMCP, Compress \
	It, ShrinkToFit, MacCompress, DiskDoubler and AutoDoubler. \
	\
	hexbin - de-hexify files created in BinHex 4.0 compatible format (hqx) \
	but also the older format (dl, hex and hcx).  Moreover it will uudecode \
	files uuencoded by UUTool (the only program I know that does UU \
	hexification of all Mac file information). \
	\
	macsave - reads a MacBinary stream from standard input and writes the \
	files according to the options.  Optionally self-extracting archives are \
	modified to normal archives. \
	\
	macstream - reads files from the Unix host and will output a MacBinary \
	stream containing all those files together with information about the \
	directory structure. \
	\
	binhex - reads a MacBinary stream, or will read files/directories as \
	indicated on the command line, and will output all files in binhexed \
	(.hqx) format.  Information about the directory structure is lost. \
	\
	tomac - transmits a MacBinary stream, or named files to the Mac using \
	the XMODEM protocol. \
	\
	frommac - receives one or more files from the Mac using the XMODEM \
	protocol.

description         monitor the progress of data through a pipe

long_description    pv - Pipe Viewer - is a terminal-based tool for monitoring \
                    the progress of data through a pipeline. It can be \
                    inserted into any normal pipeline between two processes to \
                    give a visual indication of how quickly data is passing \
                    through, how long it has taken, how near to completion it \
                    is, and an estimate of how long it will be until completion.

description         Tail multiple files in one terminal at once
long_description    MultiTail lets you view one or multiple files like the \
    original tail program. The difference is that it creates multiple \
    windows on your console (with ncurses). Merging of 2 or even more \
    logfiles is possible. It can also use colors while displaying the \
    logfiles (through regular expressions), for faster recognition of what \
    is important and what not. It can also filter lines (again with \
    regular expressions). It has interactive menus for editing given \
    regular expressions and deleting and adding windows. One can also have \
    windows with the output of shell scripts and other software. When \
    viewing the output of external software, MultiTail can mimic the \
    functionality of tools like 'watch' and such.

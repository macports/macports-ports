description         High level CLI utility for restic

long_description    Autorestic is a wrapper around the amazing restic. \
                    While being amazing the restic cli can be a bit overwhelming \
                    and difficult to manage if you have many different location \
                    that you want to backup to multiple locations. \
                    This utility is aimed at making this easier.

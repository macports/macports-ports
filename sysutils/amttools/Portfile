description         Intel AMT® Serial-over-LAN client and tools
long_description    AMT (included in Intel vPro and Centrino Pro) provides \
                    out-of-band (OOB) management for Desktops and Laptops, \
                    using an agent integrated in the network adapter and \
                    in the motherboard. \
                    Serial-over-lan provides a secure way to connect a \
                    remote computer, through a pseudo serial interface. \
                    amtterm and gamt are two terminal tools to connect to \
                    that pseudo serial interface from a remote computer. \
                    amttool is a perl script to gather information about \
                    and remotely control AMT managed computers. \
                    Note that AMT 9.0 dropped support for the old SOAP- \
                    protocol-based communication this package implements. \
                    Newer versions use WS Management implemented starting \
                    with AMT 3.0 and are not supported by this software.

# Sometimes people are trying to be just a little bit too smart.
# Revert this.
# In a perfect world, everyone would be using trace mode and
# even if GTK+3 and libvte were installed, they couldn't be
# picked up by the build system.
# Sadly, our world is not perfect, so patch out gamt support.
# (And drop this patch in the gtk variant...)

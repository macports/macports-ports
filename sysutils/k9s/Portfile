description         K9s
long_description    K9s provides a curses based terminal UI to interact with \
                    your Kubernetes clusters. The aim of this project is to \
                    make it easier to navigate, observe and manage your \
                    applications in the wild. K9s continually watches \
                    Kubernetes for changes and offers subsequent commands to \
                    interact with observed Kubernetes resources.

long_description    rr is a basic command-line utility designed to \
                    retain/recall file and directory paths. This is done by \
                    treating the filename itself as a unique key to be \
                    referenced for future rr program calls. The purpose of \
                    this is to assist the user in shorthand typing and/or \
                    not having to remember arbitrary full paths.

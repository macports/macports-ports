description	ipcs / ipcrm commands for os x
long_description \
	The ipcs command can be used to obtain the status of all 	\
	System V IPC objects. The ipcrm command can be used to remove 	\
	an IPC object from the kernel. While IPC objects can be 	\
	removed via system calls in user code, the need often arises, 	\
	especially under development environments, to remove IPC 	\
	objects manually.

description	Keep ssh and telnet connections from dropping due to inactivity
long_description	  Spinner is a small program that displays a little "spinning" \
			  ASCII character in the top left corner of your terminal. \
			  To make this effect it cycles through punctuation marks like \
			  this " - \ | / - \ | / ... " (try it to see). By default the \
			  character is drawn in inverse video (or your terminal's equivalent). \
			  But you can turn this off with the -i switch. It supports any \
			  terminal capable of handling VT100 style escape codes.\
			  Spinner is useful for keeping telnet and ssh links from dropping \
			  due to inactivity. Many firewalls, and some ISPs drop connections \
			  when they are perceived as idle. By having spinner running the \
			  server is constantly sending a tiny amount of data over the link, \
			  preserving the connection. Thus Spinner is an anti-dle, timeout \
			  preventing, background daemon process for unix variants including linux.

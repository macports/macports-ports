description     Keep ssh and telnet connections from dropping due to inactivity
long_description \
    Spinner is a small program that displays a little "spinning" \
    ASCII character in the top left corner of your terminal. \
    To make this effect it cycles through punctuation marks like \
    this " - \ | / - \ | / ... " (try it to see). By default the \
    character is drawn in inverse video (or your terminal`s equivalent). \
    But you can turn this off with the -i switch. It supports any \
    terminal capable of handling VT100 style escape codes.\
    Spinner is useful for keeping telnet and ssh links from dropping \
    due to inactivity. Many firewalls, and some ISPs drop connections \
    when they are perceived as idle. By having spinner running the \
    server is constantly sending a tiny amount of data over the link, \
    preserving the connection. Thus Spinner is an anti-dle, timeout \
    preventing, background daemon process.

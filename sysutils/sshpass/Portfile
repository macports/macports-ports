description         Non-interactive ssh password authentication

long_description    SSH's (secure shell) most common authentication mode is \
                    called \"interactive keyboard password authentication\", so \
                    called both because it is typically done via keyboard, \
                    and because openssh takes active measures to make sure \
                    that the password is, indeed, typed interactively by the \
                    keyboard. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to fool ssh \
                    into accepting an interactive password non-interactively. \
                    This is where sshpass comes in. \
                    SECURITY NOTE: There is a reason openssh insists that \
                    passwords be typed interactively. Passwords are harder \
                    to store securely and to pass around securely between \
                    programs. If you have not looked into solving your needs \
                    using SSH's \"public key authentication\", perhaps in \
                    conjunction with the ssh agent (RTFM ssh-add), please do \
                    so before being tempted into using this package.

.SH NAME
samunlock \- unlock users in the SAM user database
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the

command.

.PP
.B samunlock
is a non-interactive command line utility that can unlock a user
and/or the user's account bits from the SAM user database file of a
Microsoft Windows system (Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8.1, etc.).
This file is usually located at
\\WINDOWS\\system32\\config\\SAM on the file system of a Microsoft Windows 
Operating System

On success, the program does not output any informatin and the exit code is 0.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-u <user>

hexadecimal (if the username is preceded with '0x'). Usernames including
international characters will probably not work.
.TP

.B \-H
Output human readable output. The program by default will print a parsable table unless

.TP
.B \-E
Do not expand the hive file (safe mode).
.TP
.B \-t
Print debug information of allocated blocks.
.TP
.B \-v
Print verbose information and debug messages.

.B samunlock -U -u theboss
Unlock an user named 'theboss', if found.

.TP
.B samunlock -U -u 0x3ea
Unlock an user with RID '0x3a'.

.SH KNOWN BUGS

If the username includes international (non-ASCII) characters the program
will not (usually) find it. Use the RID number instead.

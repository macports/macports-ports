# chntpw has not been updated since 2014. These Debian patches maintain the
# package, fixing several bugs and other correctness problems. They come from
# https://sources.debian.org/patches/chntpw/140201-1/
# (https://sources.debian.org/data/main/c/chntpw/140201-1/debian/patches/). Of
# the patches there, 02_upstream_documents, 03_keyname-overflow, and
# 05_control_empty_values do not apply, are not listed in the series file, and
# are absent here. 01_port_to_gcrypt.patch has also been excluded: it adds
# libgcrypt as a cryptographic library as an alternative to OpenSSL, but the
# package is not built with any crypto enabled (here or in Debian) because its
# cryptographic features for changing (as opposed to clearing) passwords do not
# work properly with modern versions of Windows, and so the patch provides no
# benefit.
#
# patch-Makefile.diff and patch-warnings_64bit.diff are specific to MacPorts.

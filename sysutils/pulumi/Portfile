description         Pulumi - Modern Infrastructure as Code. Any cloud, any \
                    language.

long_description    Pulumi's Infrastructure as Code SDK is the easiest way to \
                    create and deploy cloud software that use containers, \
                    serverless functions, hosted services, and \
                    infrastructure, on any cloud. Simply write code in your \
                    favorite language and Pulumi automatically provisions and \
                    manages your AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and/or \
                    Kubernetes resources, using an infrastructure-as-code \
                    approach. Skip the YAML, and use standard language \
                    features like loops, functions, classes, and package \
                    management that you already know and love.

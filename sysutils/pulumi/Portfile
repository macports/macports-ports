    Pulumi - Modern Infrastructure as Code. Any cloud, any language.

long_description    \
    Pulumi's Infrastructure as Code SDK is the easiest way to create and \
    deploy cloud software that use containers, serverless functions, hosted \
    services, and infrastructure, on any cloud. Simply write code in your \
    favorite language and Pulumi automatically provisions and manages your \
    AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and/or Kubernetes resources, using an \
    infrastructure-as-code approach. Skip the YAML, and use standard language \
    features like loops, functions, classes, and package management that you \
    already know and love.

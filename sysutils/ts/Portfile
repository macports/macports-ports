long_description    task spooler is a Unix batch system where the tasks spooled run \
                    one after the other. The amount of jobs to run at once can be set \
                    at any time. Each user in each system has his own job queue. The \
                    tasks are run in the correct context (that of enqueue) from any \
                    shell/process, and its output/results can be easily watched. \
                    It is very useful when you know that your commands depend on a \
                    lot of RAM, a lot of disk use, give a lot of output, or for \
                    whatever reason it's better not to run them all at the same \
                    time, while you want to keep your resources busy for maximum \
                    benfit. Its interface allows using it easily in scripts.

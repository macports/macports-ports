description          A fork of brkirch's afsctool utility, featuring several improvements.
long_description     AFSC (Apple File System Compression) tool is a utility that can be used to \
    apply HFS+/APFS compression to file(s), decompress HFS+/APFS compressed file(s), \
    or get information about existing HFS+/APFS compressed file(s). macOS 10.6 or \
    later is required. This fork has several modifications, mostly concerning the \
    compression feature, including: improved error reporting, an attempt to reduce \
    memory pressure pressure compressing large files, support for multiple \
    files/folders specified on the commandline, a backup option while compressing \
    (that comes in addition to the existing undo if something went wrong), and \
    support for files that are read-only (and/or write-only) by changing their \
    permissions temporarily. No error checking is done for this feature\; failure \
    will lead to errors that are already caught. The main new feature that justifies \
    the version bump, however, is the parallel processing feature, allowing the user \
    to specify an arbitrary (though positive :)) number of threads that will \
    compress the specified files in parallel.

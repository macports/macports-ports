Historically, MacPorts has (probably by mistake, or coincidence) shipped
all of screen's compiled termcaps in the ncurses package. This doesn't seem
to have broken anything because this is all obscure, obsolete crap anyway
and screen also defines TERM/TERMCAP environment variables in its screens.

Unless this needs to change, remove the call to tic in the Makefile install
target. If you need the files from screen, you need to call it as

tic -o${destroot}${prefix}/share/terminfo ${worksrcpath}/terminfo/screeninfo.src

as tic will otherwise write to /opt/local on the machine that *builds* screen and
none of the files will make it into the MacPorts package!

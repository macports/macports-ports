description         Online encrypted backup service (client)

long_description    Tarsnap is an online encrypted backup service.  It \
                    presents a tar-like command-line interface, but stores \
                    data online rather than locally\; using ideas taken from \
                    the author's FreeBSD Update and Portsnap utilities, it \
                    maximizes performance by recognizing duplicate data and \
                    only storing it once, and cryptographically encrypts and \
                    signs archives using locally-held keys in order to \
                    guarantee that nobody without access to the key file \
                    (including the author) can read or modify archives.

notes "
If you have never used tarsnap before, you will need to create an account\
with the tarsnap service and deposit money into the account before you\
can start using tarsnap; see

\thttps://www.tarsnap.com/gettingstarted.html

for details.

Once you have a tarsnap account you will need to create a key file using\
the tarsnap-keygen utility before you start storing archives; this key\
file MUST BE KEPT IN A SAFE LOCATION since you will not be able to read\
your backups without it.

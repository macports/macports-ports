description \
    put your Mac to sleep from the command-line

long_description \
    SleepNow is a Mac OS X command-line tool which puts \
    the machine to sleep, just as though someone had \
    used the Sleep menu command while sitting in front \
    of the machine. The advantage is that SleepNow can \
    be run while logged in to the machine from anywhere \
    on the net.

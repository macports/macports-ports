description             GNU File, Shell, and Text utilities
long_description        The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell, and \
                        text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating \
                        system. These are the core utilities which are \
                        expected to exist on every operating system. \
                        Previously these utilities were offered as three \
                        individual sets of GNU utilities, fileutils, \
                        shellutils, and textutils. Those three have been \
                        combined into a single set of utilities called the \
                        coreutils.

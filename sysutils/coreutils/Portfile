long_description \
    The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell, and text          \
    manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system. These are the   \
    core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating       \
    system. Previously these utilities were offered as three individual \
    sets of GNU utilities, fileutils, shellutils, and textutils. Those  \
    three have been combined into a single set of utilities called the  \
    coreutils.

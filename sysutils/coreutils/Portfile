description     GNU File, Shell, and Text utilities

long_description \
    The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell, and text \
    manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system. These are the \
    core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating \
    system. Previously these utilities were offered as three individual \
    sets of GNU utilities, fileutils, shellutils, and textutils. Those \
    three have been combined into a single set of utilities called the \
    coreutils.

notes "
    The tools provided by GNU coreutils are prefixed with the character 'g' by default to distinguish them from the BSD commands.
    For example, cp becomes gcp and ls becomes gls.

    If you want to use the GNU tools by default, add this directory to the front of your PATH environment variable:
        ${prefix}/libexec/gnubin/

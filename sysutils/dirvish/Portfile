description     Client/server rsync- and hard-link-based snapshot backup system

long_description \
{Dirvish is a "Time-Machine-alike" for UNIX- and UNIX-like machines (e.g., \
FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X < 10.5) that allows for snapshot-style \
backups that preserve space by hard-linking to unchanged versions of files in \
a given backup tree.  Like Time Machine, it allows each snapshot to present a \
full tree, even for incremental backups. However, because only OS X has \
fseventsd, and because among backup sysems only Time Machine actually uses \
it, other client systems have to do a traditional tree walk to find changed \
files. \
 \
Dirvish transmits changed files (or portions of changed files) via rsync to \
the backup server, which in turn maintains the backup repository as a set of \
hard-linked trees, with databases to track what has changed, as well as an \
optional locate index to provide fast searching in the backup tree.  There is \
no GUI; however, dirvish appears to be much more robust than other software \
of this type in its exclude processing. \
 \
Using dirvish, your OS X Mac can become a snapshot backup server for your \
non-OS X (or your pre-Leopard OS X) UNIX- and UNIX-like machines.}

description         Client/server rsync- and hard-link-based snapshot backup system

long_description    {Dirvish is a "Time-Machine-alike" for UNIX- and UNIX-like machines (e.g., \
                    FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X < 10.5) that allows for snapshot-style \
                    backups that preserve space by hard-linking to unchanged versions of files in \
                    a given backup tree.  Like Time Machine, it allows each snapshot to present a \
                    full tree, even for incremental backups. However, because only OS X has \
                    fseventsd, and because among backup sysems only Time Machine actually uses \
                    it, other client systems have to do a traditional tree walk to find changed \
                    files. \
                     \
                    Dirvish transmits changed files (or portions of changed files) via rsync to \
                    the backup server, which in turn maintains the backup repository as a set of \
                    hard-linked trees, with databases to track what has changed, as well as an \
                    optional locate index to provide fast searching in the backup tree.  There is \
                    no GUI; however, dirvish appears to be much more robust than other software \
                    of this type in its exclude processing. \
                     \
                    Using dirvish, your OS X Mac can become a snapshot backup server for your \
                    non-OS X (or your pre-Leopard OS X) UNIX- and UNIX-like machines.}

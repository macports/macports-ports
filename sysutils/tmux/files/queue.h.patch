Rename header guards on compat/queue.h

Some platforms (â€¦macOS) have a <sys/queue.h> but it isn't full-featured
enough to have all the functionality we need (e.g. TAILQ_REPLACE). This
means the configure check fails and we fall back to our compatibility
header, but if *someone else* happens to include the system header first
then it will activate the _SYS_QUEUE_H_ header guard and ours will not
define anything. Since we can't really control whether the system header
is included or not (it is pulled in transitively) we probably should
just rename ours so it doesn't conflict.

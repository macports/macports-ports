description         \
    Kluctl combines Helm, Kustomize and more to handle large deployments in \
    a manageable and unified way.

long_description    \
    Kluctl is the missing glue that puts together your (and any third-party) \
    deployments into one large declarative Kubernetes deployment, while \
    making it fully manageable \(deploy, diff, prune, delete, ...\) via one \
    unified command line interface. Kluctl tries to be as flexible as \
    possible, while remaining as simple as possible. It reuses established \
    tools (e.g. Kustomize and Helm), making it possible to re-use a large set \
    of available third-party deployments. Kluctl is centered around \
    \"targets\", which can be a cluster or a specific environment \(e.g. \
    test, dev, prod, ...\) on one or multiple clusters. Targets can be \
    deployed, diffed, pruned, deleted, and so on. The idea is to have the \
    same set of operations for every target, no matter how simple or complex \
    the deployment and/or target is. Kluctl does not depend on external \
    operators\/controllers and allows to use the same deployment wherever you \
    want, as long as access to the kluctl project and clusters is available. \
    This means, that you can use it from your local machine, from your CI/CD \
    pipelines or any automation platform/system that allows to call custom \
    tools.

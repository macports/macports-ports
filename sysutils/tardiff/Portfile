description         compares the contents of two tarballs

long_description    TarDiff compares the contents of two tarballs and reports \
                    on any differences found between them. Its use is mainly \
                    for release managers who can use it as a QA tool to make \
                    sure no files have accidentally been left over or were \
                    added by mistake. TarDiff supports compressed tarballs, \
                    diff statistics and suppression of GNU autotool changes.

description         Diff your Docker containers

long_description    \
    ${name} is a tool for analyzing and comparing container images. ${name} \
    can examine images along several different criteria, including Docker \
    Image History, Image file system, Image size, Apt packages, RPM packages, \
    pip packages, npm packages. These analyses can be performed on a single \
    image, or a diff can be performed on two images to compare. The tool can \
    help users better understand what is changing inside their images, and \
    give them a better look at what their images contain.

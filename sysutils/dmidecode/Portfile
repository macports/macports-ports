description         Tool for dumping DMI (SMBIOS) contents in human-readable format.

long_description    dmidecode reports information about your system's hardware as described in your \
    system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard. This information typically \
    includes system manufacturer, model name, serial number, BIOS version, asset tag \
    as well as a lot of other details of varying level of interest and reliability \
    depending on the manufacturer. This will often include usage status for the CPU \
    sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI, ISA) and memory module slots, and the \
    list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel, USB).

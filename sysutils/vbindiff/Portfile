description         Visual Binary Diff
long_description    VBinDiff (Visual Binary Diff) displays files in \
                    hexadecimal and ASCII (or EBCDIC). It can also display \
                    two files at once, and highlight the differences between \
                    them. Unlike diff, it works well with large files (up to \
                    4 GB).

description		cronolog is a web log rotation program
long_description	cronolog is a simple filter program that reads log file \
				entries from standard input and writes each entry to the \
				output file specified by a filename template and the current \
				date and time. When the expanded filename changes, the \
				current file is closed and a new one opened. \
				This development release of 1.7 adds patches to support \
				helper programs that can process a log after it is rolled. \
				Run cronolog with no options for help.

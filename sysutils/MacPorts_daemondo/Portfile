description         HACK to get daemondo into mpkg
long_description    Nasty ${description}. \
                    When using MacPorts to create an mpkg, any daemons requiring daemondo \
                    would fail.  Adding this port as dependency permits them to work.

# We'll force the install and overwrite daemondo...with itself!
# But now we can add this as a dependency to the mpkg

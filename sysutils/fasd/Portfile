description         Fasd (pronounced similar to 'fast') is a command-line \
                    productivity booster.
long_description    ${description} Fasd offers quick access to files and \
                    directories for POSIX shells. It is inspired by tools like \
                    autojump, z and v. Fasd keeps track of files and \
                    directories you have accessed, so that you can quickly \
                    reference them in the command line.

long_description    OSSP iselect is an interactive line selection tool for textual files, \
                    operating via a full-screen Curses-based terminal session. It can be used \
                    either as an user interface frontend controlled by a scripting backend as its \
                    wrapper or in batch mode as a pipeline filter (usually between grep and the \
                    final executing command).

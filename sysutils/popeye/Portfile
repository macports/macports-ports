description         A Kubernetes Cluster Sanitizer

long_description    \
    Popeye is a utility that scans live Kubernetes clusters and reports \
    potential issues with deployed resources and configurations. It sanitizes \
    your cluster based on what’s deployed and not what’s sitting on disk. By \
    scanning your cluster, it detects misconfigurations and helps you to \
    ensure that best practices are in place, thus preventing future \
    headaches. It aims at reducing the cognitive overload one faces when \
    operating a Kubernetes cluster in the wild. Furthermore, if your cluster \
    employs a metric-server, it reports potential resources over/under \
    allocations and attempts to warn you should your cluster run out of \
    capacity.  Popeye is a readonly tool, it does not alter any of your \
    Kubernetes resources in any way!

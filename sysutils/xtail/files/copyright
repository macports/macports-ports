 The license for archival software published on my website is here:
 http://www.unicom.com/sw/license
 .
 Except a couple years ago I started releasing my stuff into the public
 domain with an "Unlicense" statement. (unlicense.org)
 .
 You may choose either one (my preference would be Unlicense). If you
 need something other than this email to document this, let me know.

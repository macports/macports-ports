description         like 'tail -f' on a bunch of files at once
long_description    xtail watches the growth of files. It's like running a \
            "tail -f" on a bunch of files at once. My favorite \
            usage is: xtail /var/log/* \
                        You can specify both filenames and directories on the \
            command line. If you specify a directory, it watches all \
            the files in that directory. It will notice when new files \
            are created (and start watching them) or when old files are \
            deleted (and stop watching them). \
            The version 2.1 release fixes a Y2K bug, replaces the fixed-length \
            file list with a dynamically allocated one, and implements package \
            configuration with GNU autoconf.

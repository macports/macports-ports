long_description    FreeIPMI provides in-band and out-of-band IPMI software \
                    based on the IPMI v1.5/2.0 specification. The IPMI \
                    specification defines a set of interfaces for platform \
                    management and is implemented by a number vendors for \
                    system management. The features of IPMI that most users \
                    will be interested in are sensor monitoring, system event \
                    monitoring, power control, and serial-over-LAN (SOL). The \
                    FreeIPMI tools and libraries listed below should provide \
                    users with the ability to access and utilize these and \
                    many other features. A number of useful features for \
                    large HPC or cluster environments have also been \
                    implemented into FreeIPMI.

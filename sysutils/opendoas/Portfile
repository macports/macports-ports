description         Run a command as another user
long_description \
    The doas utility is a program originally written for OpenBSD \
    which allows a user to run a command as though they were another \
    user. Typically doas is used to allow non-privileged users to \
    run commands as though they were the root user. The doas program \
    acts as an alternative to sudo, which is a popular method for \
    granting admin access to specific users.

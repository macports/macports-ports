description         monit is a utility for managing and monitoring, processes, \
                    files, directories and devices on a UNIX system.
long_description    Monit can start a process if it does not run, restart a process \
                    if it does not respond and stop a process if it uses too many resources. \
                    You can use monit to monitor files, directories and devices for changes, \
                    such as timestamp changes, checksum changes or size changes. You can also \
                    monitor remote hosts\; monit can ping a remote host and can check TCP/IP \
                    port connections and server protocols. Monit is controlled via an easy \
                    to use control file based on a free-format, token-oriented syntax. Monit \
                    logs to syslog or to its own log file and notifies you about error \
                    conditions and recovery status via customizable alert.

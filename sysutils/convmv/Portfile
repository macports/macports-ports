description		Convert filenames from one encoding to another
long_description	convmv is meant to help convert a single filename, a \
			directory tree and the contained files or a whole filesystem into \
			a different encoding. It just converts the filenames, not the \
			content of the files. A special feature of convmv is that it also \
			takes care of symlinks, also converts the symlink target pointer \
			in case the symlink target is being converted, too. All this comes \
			in very handy when one wants to switch over from old 8-bit locales \
			to UTF-8 locales. It is also possible to convert directories to \
			UTF-8 which are already partly UTF-8 encoded. convmv is able to \
			detect if certain files are UTF-8 encoded and will skip them by \
			default. To turn this smartness off use the --nosmart switch.

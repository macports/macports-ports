description         Convert filenames from one encoding to another

long_description    convmv is meant to help convert a single filename, a \
                    directory tree and the contained files or a whole \
                    filesystem into a different encoding. It just converts \
                    the filenames, not the content of the files. A special \
                    feature of convmv is that it also takes care of symlinks, \
                    also converts the symlink target pointer in case the \
                    symlink target is being converted, too. All this comes \
                    in very handy when one wants to switch over from old \
                    8-bit locales to UTF-8 locales. It is also possible to \
                    convert directories to UTF-8 which are already partly \
                    UTF-8 encoded. convmv is able to detect if certain files \
                    are UTF-8 encoded and will skip them by default. To turn \
                    this smartness off use the --nosmart switch.

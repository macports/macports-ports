description         A tool for creating identical machine images for multiple \
                    platforms from a single source configuration.

long_description    ${description} \
                    Packer is lightweight, runs on every major operating \
                    system, and is highly performant, creating machine images \
                    for multiple platforms in parallel. Packer comes out of \
                    the box with support for many platforms, the full list of \
                    which can be found at \
                    https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/index.html.

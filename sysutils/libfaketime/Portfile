description         libfaketime modifies the system time for a single application

long_description    libfaketime intercepts various system calls that applications use to \
                    retrieve the current date and time. It can then report user-specified \
                    faked dates and times to these applications. This allows us to modify \
                    the system time an application sees without having to change the time \
                    system-wide. The faketime wrapper can be used from command line. \
                    Check the documentation on how to integrate into installed applications.

notes {
    With System Integrity Protection (SIP) enabled on macOS 10.11 El Capitan\
    or later, it is not possible to override date and time for system\
    binaries in /bin or /usr/bin as DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES will be ignored.\
    This also applies to shell scripts invoked through #!/bin/sh or similar.

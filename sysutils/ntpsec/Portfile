# 10.5 x86_64 builds successfully and passes all build tests, but doesn't
# actually work.  This has apparently been true forever, but until recently,
# dependency issues prevented building it at all.  Since this is a rare case
# and not really a regression, we simply disallow it for now.  It's unknown
# whether 10.4 x86_64 has the same issue, but we also disallow that out of
# conservatism.  This should be removed once the code is fixed.

# To avoid breaking any code that uses our Python package, keep the Python
# version at 2.7 until we add variants for Python versions.  The upstream
# code itself works with 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3+.
python.versions     27

# Note that the upstream --python option may not work correctly, so waf
# must be run with the target Python version.  The waf PortGroup doesn't
# currently allow selecting its Python version, but since it's hard-coded
# for 2.7, we can ignore this for now.

# Also note that the new ffi-based Python client library doesn't work properly
# on the Mac, so we use the old extension-based version.

# The installed ntpsec code builds correctly with openssl3, though one of
# the "attic" programs included (erroneously) in the default build does not.
# Although this is easily fixed, openssl3 itself currently fails to build
# in certain cases, so we keep this on openssl11 for now.
#
# Since OpenSSL 1.1 is still fully supported, adequate for ntpsec, and has no
# licensing issues for ntpsec, there's no rush to move to OpenSSL 3, which might
# as well wait for the next ntpsec release (or later, if openssl3 isn't fully
# fixed by then).

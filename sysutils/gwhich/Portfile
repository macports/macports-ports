long_description \
    Which is a utility that prints out the full path of the \
    executables that bash(1) would execute when the passed \
    program names would have been entered on the shell prompt. \
    It does this by using the exact same algorithm as bash. \
    Tildes and a dot in the PATH are now expanded to the \
    full path by default.  Options allow to rather print \
    "~/*" or "./*" and/or to print all executables that \
    match any directory in PATH.

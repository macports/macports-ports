                    \n\nRawhide (rh) lets you search for files on the command line using \
                    expressions and user-defined functions in a mini-language inspired by C. \
                    It's like find(1), but more fun to use. Search criteria can be very \
                    readable and self-explanatory and/or very concise and typeable, and you can \
                    create your own lexicon of search terms. The output can include lots of \
                    detail, like ls(1).

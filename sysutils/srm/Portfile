description	srm is a secure replacement for rm(1).
long_description	srm is a secure replacement for rm(1). Unlike the \
			standard rm, it overwrites the data in the target files \
			before unlinking them. This prevents command-line recovery \
			of the data by examining the raw block device. It may also \
			help frustrate physical examination of the disk, although \
			it's unlikely that it can completely prevent that type of \
			recovery. It is, essentially, a paper shredder for sensitive files.

     # we are rather picky about msgpack versions, because a good working msgpack is
     # very important for borg, see https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/3753
     # best versions seem to be 0.4.6, 0.4.7, 0.4.8 and 0.5.6:
-    'msgpack-python >=0.4.6, <=0.5.6, !=0.5.0, !=0.5.1, !=0.5.2, !=0.5.3, !=0.5.4, !=0.5.5',

+    'msgpack >=0.5.6;python_version >="3.5"',
     # if you can't satisfy the above requirement, these are versions that might
     # also work ok, IF you make sure to use the COMPILED version of msgpack-python,
     # NOT the PURE PYTHON fallback implementation: ==0.5.1, ==0.5.4

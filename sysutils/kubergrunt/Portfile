long_description    kubergrunt is a standalone go binary with a collection of \
                    commands that attempts to fill in the gaps between \
                    Terraform, Helm, and Kubectl for managing a Kubernetes \
                    Cluster. Some of the features of kubergrunt include: \
                    Configuring kubectl to authenticate with a given EKS \
                    cluster, managing Helm and associated TLS certificates \
                    on any Kubernetes cluster, setting up Helm client with \
                    TLS certificates on any Kubernetes cluster. generating \
                    TLS certificate key pairs and storing them as Kubernetes \
                    Secrets on any Kubernetes cluster.

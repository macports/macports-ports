# This is the default chrony.conf file adapted from Debian

# See www.pool.ntp.org for an explanation of these servers.  Please
# consider joining the project if possible.  If you can't or don't want to
# use these servers I suggest that you try your ISP's nameservers.  We mark
# the servers 'offline' so that chronyd won't try to connect when the link
# is down.
#
# A Helper application, chrony-netchanged, monitors the network state and
# checks the reachability of the first configured server found in this
# file.  It invokes the script @PREFIX@/etc/chrony/chrony-netchange
# which uses chronyc commands to switch chronyd on when an internet link
# comes up and off when it goes down.
#
# Note that if Chrony tries to go 'online' and dns lookup of the servers
# fails they will be discarded.  Thus under some circumstances it is
# better to use IP numbers than host names.

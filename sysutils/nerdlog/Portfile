    no central server

long_description    \
    Nerdlog is a fast, remote-first, multi-host TUI log viewer with timeline \
    histogram and no central server. Loosely inspired by Graylog\/Kibana, but \
    without the bloat. Pretty much no setup needed, either. \
    \
    It\'s laser-focused on being efficient while querying logs from multiple \
    remote machines simultaneously, filtering them by time range and \
    patterns, while also drawing a timeline histogram for quick visual \
    insight. \
    \
    Primary use case: reading system logs \(\/var\/log\/messages or \
    \/var\/log\/syslog\) from one or more remote hosts. Very efficient even on \
    large log files \(like 1GB or more\). \
    \
    It does support some other log formats and can use any log files, but \
    that was the primary use case which was driving the implementation\: \
    we were having our web service backend running as systemd services on a \
    bunch of Linux instances, printing a lot of logs, and wanted to be able \
    to read these logs efficiently and having the timeline histogram, much \
    like tools like Graylog have.

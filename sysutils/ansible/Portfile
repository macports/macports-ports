description     SSH-based configuration management and deployment system
long_description \
    Ansible is a radically simple model-driven configuration \
    management, multi-node deployment, and remote task execution \
    system.  Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software \
    or daemons to be installed on remote nodes.  Extension modules can \
    be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines \
    automatically.

description             Reblocking buffer for tape writes

long_description        This is a program designed to speed up writing tapes. \
                        The program splits itself into two processes.  The first process reads \
                        (and reblocks) from stdin into a shared memory buffer.  The second \
                        writes from the shared memory buffer to stdout.  Doing it this way \
                        means that the writing side effectly sits in a tight write loop and \
                        doesn't have to wait for input.  Similarly for the input side.  It is \
                        this waiting that slows down other reblocking processes, like dd.

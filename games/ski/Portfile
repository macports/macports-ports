description         ASCII downhill skiing game
long_description    Imagine you are skiing down an infinite slope, \
                    facing such hazards as trees, ice, bare ground, \
                    and the man-eating Yeti! Unfortunately, you have \
                    put your jet-powered skis on backwards, so you \
                    can't see ahead where you are going\; only behind \
                    where you have been. However, you can turn to \
                    either side, jump or hop through the air, teleport \
                    through hyperspace, launch nuclear ICBMs, and cast \
                    spells to call the Fire Demon. And since the \
                    hazards occur in patches, you can skillfully \
                    outmaneuver them. A fun and very silly game that \
                    proves you don't need fancy graphical user \
                    interfaces to have a good time. The internals of \
                    this game are actually kind of interesting. The \
                    terrain generator is a simple cellular automaton \
                    that generates crude 2D fractals.

long_description \
    Imagine you are skiing down an infinite slope, facing such hazards \
    as trees, ice, bare ground, and the man-eating Yeti! Unfortunately, \
    you have put your jet-powered skis on backwards, so you can't see \
    ahead where you are going\; only behind where you have been. However, \
    you can turn to either side, jump or hop through the air, teleport \
    through hyperspace, launch nuclear ICBMs, and cast spells to call the \
    Fire Demon. And since the hazards occur in patches, you can \
    skillfully outmaneuver them. A fun and very silly game that proves \
    you don't need fancy graphical user interfaces to have a good time. \
    The internals of this game are actually kind of interesting. The \
    terrain generator is a simple cellular automaton that generates crude \
    2D fractals.

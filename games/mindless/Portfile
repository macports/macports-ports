long_description	\
	Mindless Automaton is a virtual tabletop on which you can play card \
	games against other people over a network.  It was designed to \
	simulate the Magic: The Gathering(R) game, but it can be expanded to \
	simulate other games. Mindless Automaton was very, very inspired by \
	the popular Windows program Apprentice.

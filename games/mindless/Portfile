description         Play collectable card games against other player
long_description    \
    Mindless Automaton is a virtual tabletop on which you can play card \
    games against other people over a network.  It was designed to \
    simulate the Magic: The Gathering(R) game, but it can be expanded to \
    simulate other games. Mindless Automaton was very, very inspired by \
    the popular Windows program Apprentice.

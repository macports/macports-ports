description             Tetris clone with multiplayer and AI support.
long_description        LTris as a tetris clone which means you have a bowl \
                        with blocks falling down. By rotating and moving the \
                        blocks you try to assemble whole lines which then \
                        disappear. LTris has three modes for this: Classic is \
                        the classical one where you play until the bowl \
                        becomes filled, Figures resets the bowl contents to a \
                        new figure for each level and adds suddenly appearing \
                        tiles and lines later on and Multiplayer where up to \
                        three players either controlled by human or CPU(!) \
                        compete and send completed lines to each other.

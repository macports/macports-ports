description         Library for poker hand evaluation, dev files
long_description    poker-eval is a C library to evaluate poker hands. \
                    The result of the evalution for a given hand is a number. \
                    The general idea is that if the evalution of your hand is \
                    lower than the evaluation of the hand of your opponent, \
                    you lose. Many poker variants are supported (draw, \
                    holdem, omaha, etc.) and more can be added.  \
                    poker-eval is designed for speed so that it can be used \
                    within poker simulation software using either exhaustive \
                    exploration or Monte Carlo.

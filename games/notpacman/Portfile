description         Pacman with physics

long_description    Ever wonder what Pacman would be like with physics? No? \
                    Well, it's revolutionary. This mashup of \"Not\" and \
                    \"Pacman\" puts The Pac and the Ghosts in a Pacworld \
                    cage, at mercy of gravity and the level's shape, \
                    controlled solely by you. Ghosts still don't like you very \
                    much, so you should be careful to make Pacman avoid them.

# The love 0.8-compatible code is not on GitHub, only in the Mac download of
# 1.0.4 on the web site. The Windows and Linux downloads of 1.0.4 are different
# and require love 0.7 and more closely match the 1.0 tag on GitHub.

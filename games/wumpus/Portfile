long_description \
    WUMPUS is a bit of retrocomputing nostalgia. It is an *exact* clone, \
    even down to the godawful user interface, of an ancient classic game. \
    This version fixes two minor bugs in my original 1992 USENET posting \
    of the source. An article describing the history of the game is at \
    http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=247 \
    SUPERHACK is a satire, structurally quite similar to WUMPUS.

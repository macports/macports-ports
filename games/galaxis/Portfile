long_description \
    UNIX-hosted, curses-based clone of the nifty little Macintosh \
    freeware game Galaxis. The code is POSIX-conforming and was \
    written under Linux using the ncurses library\; it should part \
    readily to any System V. BSD sites using the inferior native \
    BSD curses will lose some features (no color, nor arrow-key \
    support).

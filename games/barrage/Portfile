description         Action game with objective to destroy tanks, jeeps, etc.

long_description    Barrage is a rather violent action game with the \
                    objective to kill and destroy as many targets as \
                    possible within 3 minutes. You control a gun that may \
                    either fire small or large grenades at soldiers, jeeps \
                    and tanks. Targets are fast paced and require careful \
                    aiming as it takes half a second to reload the gun. \
                    Additionally you have to keep an eye on your ammo and \
                    reload in time.

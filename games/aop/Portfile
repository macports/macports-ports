description         Curses based arcade game for UNIX with only 64 lines of sourcecode.
long_description    The goal of Aop (Ambassador Of Pain) is is to drive the hoovercraft \
                    (O) trough the level into the 'at' sign (@) and reach as much points \
                    as possible by reducing the number of moves and not losing any time. \
                    Lost lifes (0) can easily be picked up by simply drive over them.

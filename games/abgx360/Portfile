long_description \
Abgx360 is the ultimate tool to check your Xbox 360 backups. \
It is able to perform a very wide range of checks upon them, \
such as checking for SS/PFI/DMI, checking for correct video \
data (including SplitVid and 3rd wave). It is also able to \
dynamically fetch missing pieces and patch your backups on\
the fly.

long_description \
    Abgx360 is the ultimate tool to check your Xbox 360 backups. \
    It is able to perform a very wide range of checks upon them, \
    such as checking for SS/PFI/DMI, checking for correct video \
    data (including SplitVid and 3rd wave). It is also able to \
    dynamically fetch missing pieces and patch your backups on \
    the fly.

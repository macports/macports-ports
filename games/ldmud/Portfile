long_description \
    LDMud started as a project to clean up and modernize Amylaar's LPMud \
    gamedriver. Primary goals are full documentation, a commented source body \
    and out-of-the-box support for the major mudlibs, of which the commented \
    source body has been pretty much completed. During the course of work a \
    lot of bug fixes and improvements found their way into the driver - much \
    more than originally expected, and definitely enough to make LDMud a \
    driver in its own right.

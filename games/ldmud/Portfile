description      modern LPMud gamedriver
long_description \
	LDMud started as a project to clean up and modernize Amylaar's \
	LPMud gamedriver. Primary goals are full documentation, a \
	commented source body and out-of-the-box support for the major \
	mudlibs, of which the commented source body has been pretty \
	much completed. During the course of work a lot of bug fixes \
	and improvements found their way into the driver - much more \
	than originally expected, and definitely enough to make LDMud \
	a driver in its own right.

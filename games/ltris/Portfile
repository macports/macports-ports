description		Tetris clone with multiplayer and AI support.
long_description	LTris as a tetris clone which means you have a bowl \
				with blocks falling down. By rotating and moving the \
				blocks you try to assemble whole lines which then \
				disappear. LTris has three modes for this: Classic is \
				the classical one where you play until the bowl \
				becomes filled, Figures resets the bowl contents to a \
				new figure for each level and adds suddenly appearing \
				tiles and lines later on and Multiplayer where up to \
				three players either controlled by human or CPU(!) \
				compete and send completed lines to each other.

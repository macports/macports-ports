description         52-card solitaire game
long_description \
    This 52-card solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and \
    dealt out in four rows. The aces are then moved to the left end \
    of the layout, making 4 initial free spaces. You may move to a \
    space only the card that matches the left neighbor in suit, and \
    is one greater in rank. Kings are high, so no cards may be placed \
    to their right (they create dead spaces). When no moves can be \
    made, cards still out of sequence are reshuffled and dealt face \
    up after the ends of the partial sequences, leaving a card space \
    after each sequence, so that each row looks like a partial \
    sequence followed by a space, followed by enough cards to make a \
    row of 14. A moment's reflection will show that this game cannot \
    take more than 13 deals. A good score is 1-3 deals, 4-7 is \
    average, 8 or more is poor.

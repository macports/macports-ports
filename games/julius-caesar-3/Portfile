description         An open source re-implementation of Caesar III

long_description    \
    Julius is a fully working open-source version of Caesar 3, with the same \
    logic as the original, but with some UI enhancements, that can be played \
    on multiple platforms. Julius will not run without the original Caesar 3 \
    files. You can buy a digital copy from GOG or Steam, or you can use an \
    original CD-ROM version. The goal of the project is to have exactly the \
    same game logic as Caesar 3, with the same look and feel. This means that \
    the saved games are 100% compatible with Caesar 3, and any gameplay bugs \
    present in the original Caesar 3 game will also be present in Julius.

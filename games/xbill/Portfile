description      Save your computers from the evil clutches of Bill
long_description \
    Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right? You're a \
    sysadmin, and someone's trying to destroy your computers. The \
    little people running around the screen are trying to infect \
    your computers with Wingdows \[TM\], a virus cleverly designed \
    to resemble a popular operating system. Additionally, some \
    computers are connected with network cables. When one \
    computer on a network becomes infected, a spark will be sent \
    down the cable, and will infect the computer on the other end \
    when it reaches there.

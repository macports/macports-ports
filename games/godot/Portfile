description         cross-platform 2-D and 3-D game development \
                    environment
long_description    Godot Engine is a cross-platform game engine for \
                    creating 2-D and 3-D games. Godot aims to offer a \
                    fully integrated game development environment. It \
                    provides a comprehensive set of common tools, and \
                    games can be exported to a number of target \
                    platforms, including major desktop platforms \
                    (Linux, macOS, Windows), as well as mobile \
                    (Android, iOS) and web-based (HTML5) platforms.

    # 2021-12-09: I believe that it would be safe to completely remove
    # this subport without needing to wait for the traditional one-year
    # waiting period. The only reason I originally created this subport
    # was because Godot 3.3+ was failing to compile for macOS <= 10.10.
    # Now that we have been able to get the source code to compile and
    # run successfully on older macOSes, this subport is no longer
    # necessary. In addition, based on the statistics, it looks like
    # no one has ever installed this subport.
}

# Note: We continue to keep the subport syntax, because we will need to
# use it in the future. When Godot 4 is released, we will still need to
# maintain a Godot 3.x subport, because Godot Engine is being rewritten
# to use Vulkan in Godot 4. This means that Godot 4 will only have the
# possibility of being executable back to macOS 10.11, because MoltenVK
# requires Metal, which was introduced in macOS 10.11.

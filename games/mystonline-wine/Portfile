notes "
Welcome to Myst Online: Uru Live Again (MO:ULagain)

* To play Myst Online, you need an account, which you can create for free by visiting\
${homepage} and clicking Play.
* Myst Online automatically updates itself.\
The first time you open Myst Online, it will download several gigabytes of game data.\
Be patient\; this will take some time.\
If you already have the game data from a non-MacPorts installation of Myst Online,\
you can save time by copying or moving it into ${assets_dir}

This version of Myst Online runs via Wine.\
Peculiarities of this method of running Myst Online include:

* Don't click anywhere in the updater window.\
If you do, the window will follow the mouse cursor and will not go away.\
If you need to cancel the updater, press the Escape key.
* The first time you log into Myst Online, you will be prompted to install PhysX.
* The mouse cursor image is wrong.
* To be able to look around by holding down the Command key while dragging,\
enable the \"Emulate three button mouse\" option in X11 preferences.
* The menubar cannot be hidden.
* The dock does not hide automatically. It can be hidden using the normal ways\
(e.g. Apple menu > Dock > Turn hiding on) but you may also want to move the dock\
to the side of the screen as otherwise it gets in the way of game play.
* The game's dock icon keeps bouncing longer than it should, doesn't show that\
it's running even when it is, and doesn't bring the game to the front if you click it.
* Accessing the dock icon's context menu doesn't let you quit the game normally,\
though it does let you force-quit it.
* The application has a generic icon.
* The game starts in fullscreen mode. If in fullscreen mode you access the game's\
graphics settings, you cannot return to the game\; you must force-quit.
* To switch between fullscreen and windowed mode, use the checkbox in the graphics settings.
* Intel GMA 950 integrated graphics cards are not supported.\
Some graphics including your avatar will not display correctly.
* If sounds are distorted or nonexistent, install the sounddecompress port and follow the instructions.
* The microphone cannot be used to talk to other players, though you can hear other players talking to you.
* On Macs with NVIDIA graphics cards, water does not show up properly in Er'cana.
* On Macs with NVIDIA graphics cards that have not upgraded to Mac OS X 10.6.3,\
Eder Kemo has severe performance problems.

Other methods of running Myst Online on a Mac include the Cider version in the mystonline-cider port,\
and running the game in Windows via VMware, Parallels or Boot Camp.

To play Myst Online, open ${app_package}.

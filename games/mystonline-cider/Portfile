notes "
Welcome to Myst Online: Uru Live Again (MO:ULagain)

* To play Myst Online, you need an account, which you can create for free by visiting\
${homepage} and clicking Play.
* Myst Online automatically updates itself.\
The first time you open Myst Online, it will download several gigabytes of game data.\
Be patient\; this will take some time.\
If you already have the game data from a non-MacPorts installation of Myst Online,\
you can save time by copying or moving it into ${assets_dir}

This version of Myst Online runs via the Cider wrapper\
developed for the GameTap version of Myst Online which ran from 2007 to 2008.\
Peculiarities of this method of running Myst Online include:

* Several icons appear and disappear in the dock while the game is starting.
* The game may crash (unexpectedly quit) when you quit it.
* If you need to force-quit the game while in fullscreen mode, press Command-Option-Escape.
* The game starts in fullscreen mode at 800x600 resolution.\
To switch to a higher resolution, use the in-game graphics settings.
* To switch between fullscreen and windowed mode, press Command-Return.
* Intel GMA 950 integrated graphics cards are not supported.\
Some graphics including your avatar will not display correctly.
* If sounds are distorted or nonexistent, install the sounddecompress port and follow the instructions.
* The microphone cannot be used to talk to other players, though you can hear other players talking to you.
* On Macs with NVIDIA graphics cards, water does not show up properly in Er'cana.
* On Macs with NVIDIA graphics cards that have not upgraded to Mac OS X 10.6.3,\
Eder Kemo has severe performance problems.

Other methods of running Myst Online on a Mac include the Wine version in the mystonline-wine port,\
and running the game in Windows via VMware, Parallels or Boot Camp.

To play Myst Online, open ${app_package}.

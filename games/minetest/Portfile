# Should not be removed and will be regular replaced by MT stable as applicable.
#
# By rev3 the port "irrlichtmt-mt56" provides 'irrlicht 1.9.0mt8' for "minetest56" ports.
# This should apply until a more stable MT 5.7.1 would be available.
#
# Rationale:  The Minetest application evidently binds to a specific IrrLichtMT fork version.
# Furthermore, many MT players tend to stick with a certain MT version as long as possible,
# because their obvious goal is having fun in a self-built kingdom inside a MT game world.
# However, due to technical quirks and compatibility issues a migration of a MT game world,
# including virtual assets built by same players for hours or even years, would be risky.
#
# WIP for MT 5.7.1 and only for the future of this port replacement definition:
# Later the port "irrlichtmt-mt57" would provide 'irrlicht 1.9.0mt9' for "minetest57" ports.

description		Globulation 2 - a free and innovative strategy game
long_description	Globulation 2 is an innovative high quality Real-Time \
				Strategy, which minimizes micro-management by automatically \
				assigning tasks to the units. The player has to choose the \
				number of units he wants for the different tasks, and the \
				units will do their best to satisfy the requests. This allows \
				to manage more units and to focus on the strategy. It can be \
				played alone, through your Local Area Network, or through \
				Internet thanks to Ysagoon Online Game, a meta-server. It also \
				features a scripting language for versatile gameplay or \
				tutorials and an integrated map editor.
